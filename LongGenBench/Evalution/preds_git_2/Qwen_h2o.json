The drive was scenic, and the kids were thrilled to see the changing landscapes. Once we arrived, we spent the day hiking through lush forests and along babbling streams. The highlight was a surprise visit to a small village where we met friendly locals who shared traditional crafts and stories. In the evening, we set up camp and enjoyed a delicious homemade meal under the stars. The next day, we explored more trails and visited a nearby waterfall.

Work continued to be demanding, with tight deadlines and presentations. I worked late into the night, but the progress on the design was encouraging. At home, we tried a new recipe for homemade pizza, which turned out to be a hit. The kids helped with the preparation, adding a fun and interactive element to the evening.

In the evenings, we enjoyed dining at local restaurants, sampling regional cuisine. The weather was mild, with temperatures around 15\u00b0C, making it pleasant for outdoor exploration.
