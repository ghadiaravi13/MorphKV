{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as demonstrators refused to leave their encampments despite eviction deadlines set by city officials. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained at City Hall, waiting for police to make a move. Mayor Nutter had given the group until 5 p.m. on Sunday to pack up and leave, but by late evening, no action had been taken. Police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan stated that there were no plans to evict the protesters that night and that the city was working towards a peaceful resolution.\n\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to disperse before dawn on Monday. Hundreds of demonstrators had gathered outside City Hall, defying a midnight deadline to leave the encampment. Four people were arrested during the confrontation, but no serious injuries were reported. The Los Angeles encampment, which had been in place since October, was one of the largest and longest-lasting Occupy protests in the country.\n\nBoth Philadelphia and Los Angeles protests were part of the larger Occupy Wall Street movement, which began in New York City in September and spread to cities across the United States. The movement's primary goal is to bring attention to economic inequality and corporate influence on government.\n\nDespite the tense standoff between protesters and law enforcement, there were signs of cooperation and understanding. In Philadelphia, police looked on calmly as protesters chanted and served soup to each other. In Los Angeles, police allowed protesters to remain on the sidewalks and even provided them with portable toilets.\n\nThe future of the Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles encampments remains uncertain. Mayor Nutter has stated that the city will begin fencing off the area around City Hall on Monday to prevent protesters from returning. In Los Angeles, city officials have not yet announced their plans for the encampment.\n\nThe Occupy movement has sparked a national conversation about economic inequality and corporate power. Supporters argue that the movement is necessary to bring about real change, while critics argue that it is disruptive and ineffective.

Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and guilt before his death in 2013, writing a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill. In the letter, Kalashnikov, who was a devout Christian, expressed his \"spiritual pain\" over the many lives lost due to his invention. He had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by the weapon. The letter, published in the pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia, raises questions about the authenticity of the content, as Kalashnikov's daughter believes a priest helped her father compose it.\n\nThe AK-47, also known as the Kalashnikov, is one of the most widely used and recognizable weapons in the world. It was designed by Kalashnikov in the late 1940s, after he was wounded in battle. The rifle's simplicity and reliability made it a popular choice among military forces and insurgents worldwide. However, Kalashnikov's pride in his invention was tempered by sadness at its use in criminal activities and conflicts.\n\nStarting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their web crawl data to the Internet Archive, which is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This data is valuable for researchers and historians, providing a snapshot of the internet at different points in time.\n\nKalashnikov died in December 2013, and his funeral was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian Orthodox Church also paid tribute to him, acknowledging his contribution to the country's defense capabilities while expressing sympathy for his spiritual concerns.\n\nThe AK-47 has a complex legacy, as it has been used in numerous conflicts and terrorist attacks, causing countless deaths and suffering. Despite this, it remains a symbol of Russian military power and innovation. Kalashnikov's late-life expression of guilt and remorse adds a nuanced perspective to the story of this iconic weapon.", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
