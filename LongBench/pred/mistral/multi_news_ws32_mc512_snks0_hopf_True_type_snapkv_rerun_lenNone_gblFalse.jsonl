Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Two researchers, Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the University of Pavia, have conducted a forensic analysis of the shroud using blood flow patterns and have concluded that the stains on the cloth are inconsistent with those that would have been produced if Jesus had been wrapped in it. The researchers used mannequins and synthetic blood to simulate the blood flow patterns that would have occurred if Jesus had been wrapped in the shroud. They found that the bloodstains on the shroud do not match the patterns that would have been produced if Jesus had been wrapped in it. The researchers also noted that some of the stains on the shroud are too large to have come from a single person. The shroud has long been a subject of debate, with some believing it to be a genuine relic and others believing it to be a forgery. The latest findings add to the debate and raise questions about the authenticity of the shroud. The researchers published their findings in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. The researchers' findings have been met with skepticism by some experts, who argue that the shroud is a complex artifact with a long and complex history, and that it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about its authenticity based on a single analysis. However, the researchers believe that their findings provide important new evidence that should be considered in the ongoing debate about the shroud's authenticity. The researchers' work is the latest in a long line of scientific investigations into the shroud, which has been the subject of intense study for centuries. The shroud is currently housed in the Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista in Turin, Italy, and is a popular pilgrimage site for Christians around the world.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Since then, more than a dozen men have come forward with similar allegations, some of which date back to the late 1980s.\n\nOne of the latest accusers is actor Jon Bernthal, who worked with Spacey on the film \"Baby Driver.\" Bernthal told SiriusXM that he had lost respect for Spacey after hearing the allegations and that he had heard stories about Spacey's inappropriate behavior before. Bernthal also revealed that he had spoken to other cast members about their experiences with Spacey, and they had all shared similar stories.\n\nSpacey's behavior reportedly extended beyond just inappropriate comments and advances. According to a report in USA Today, more than a dozen men have accused Spacey of sexual misconduct, including groping, unwanted touching, and attempts to initiate sexual encounters. Some of these allegations date back to the late 1980s, and some of the accusers were underage at the time.\n\nThe accusations against Spacey have led to significant consequences. Netflix announced that it was cutting ties with Spacey, canceling the production of the sixth season of \"House of Cards,\" in which Spacey starred as Frank Underwood. Ridley Scott also removed Spacey's scenes from the completed film \"All the Money in the World,\" and reshot them with Christopher Plummer, who took over the role of J.

In a statement, he apologized for any behavior that may have caused \"pain and anguish,\" but did not specifically address the allegations. He also posted a video on YouTube in which he came out as gay, which many saw as an attempt to deflect attention from the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nThe accusations against Spacey are part of a larger trend of sexual misconduct allegations in the entertainment industry.

At Marden Henge, a rectangular Neolithic house dating back over 4,300 years has been unearthed. The house, which is believed to predate Stonehenge, will be open to visitors next weekend as part of the national festival of archaeology. The well-preserved structure is made of timber and clay and is one of the best-preserved Neolithic houses ever found in the UK. The site also includes a Bronze Age burial mound and a Roman villa.\n\nAt Wilsford, another Neolithic site, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age child's skeleton was discovered. The child is believed to have been between 5 and 7 years old and was buried with a pottery vessel. The findings are part of a larger dig aimed at understanding the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nDr Jim Leary, the director of the excavation, stated that Marden Henge is one of the biggest and most impressive prehistoric monuments in Britain and that it could well be that this was the center of Neolithic life in the region. The site is larger than both Stonehenge and Avebury and is believed to have been used for social and religious gatherings.\n\nThe Vale of Pewsey, where these sites are located, has been neglected in archaeological research compared to the more famous sites of Stonehenge and Avebury.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

The dinosaur is unique for its iridescent rainbow-colored feathers, which were preserved alongside its bones. The discovery suggests that dinosaurs had a more colorful and diverse appearance than previously believed. The dinosaur is a theropod, with a body size similar to a crow, and had a crest on its head. It is the earliest known dinosaur with asymmetrical feathers, which are a key adaptation for flight. The discovery was made in northeastern China and is described in a study published in the journal Nature Communications. The researchers believe that the iridescence in the feathers may have been used for display purposes, similar to how some modern birds use colorful plumage to attract mates. The discovery of Caihong juji sheds new light on the evolution of feathers and their role in dinosaur behavior. The researchers are continuing to study the fossil to learn more about this intriguing dinosaur.\n\nPassage 2 provides additional details about the discovery, including the fact that the dinosaur had a bird-like skeleton and was likely a glider rather than a flyer.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones?

The House passed a bill to fund the government through December 15th, with a provision to delay Obamacare for a year, while the Senate rejected it. President Obama has threatened to veto any legislation that attempts to undermine the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe economic impact of a government shutdown could be significant, particularly in the Washington D.C. area, where federal employees make up a large portion of the workforce. An estimated $200 million in economic activity could be lost daily, and the ripple effect could extend to local and state governments.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been urging House Republicans to pass a clean continuing resolution to fund the government without any conditions.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

This risk was even higher for individuals with pre-existing coronary artery disease, with a 127% increased risk.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition where the major blood vessels that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients become damaged or diseased. This can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, and strokes.

According to a study published in the journal Cancer, one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50.

They found that younger patients with colorectal cancer had similar outcomes to older patients, but they were more likely to be diagnosed at later stages. This suggests that earlier detection through screening could improve outcomes for younger patients.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients were more likely to have aggressive forms of the disease, such as those with poorer differentiation or lymph node involvement. These findings underscore the importance of early detection and screening for younger adults.\n\nThe study's authors call for a reevaluation of colorectal cancer screening guidelines to include younger adults.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "\n\nIn the realm of space exploration and advanced civilizations, several intriguing concepts have emerged in recent news. One such idea is the expansion of a civilization into the universe, as proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. This concept, known as the Kardashev scale, suggests that civilizations can be classified based on their energy consumption, with Type I civilizations utilizing all the energy available on their planet, Type II harnessing the energy of their star, and Type III utilizing the energy of their entire galaxy.\n\nA new twist on this concept comes from a paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, who suggests that advanced civilizations may be racing against the clock to harvest energy from distant stars, as the universe is expanding and stars are becoming increasingly inaccessible. Hooper proposes that these civilizations may construct massive energy-collecting structures, such as Dyson spheres, to capture the energy of their stars.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internet Archive has announced the creation of a collection called WARCZone, which contains uploaded files from the Wayback Machine that were not successfully archived. This collection is intended to serve as a reference for the Wayback Team and the general public.\n\nLastly, science fiction author Olaf Stapledon's description of advanced civilizations constructing Dyson spheres has been revisited in recent discussions about the search for intelligent life in the universe. These structures, which would encompass entire stars, could potentially provide the energy required for advanced civilizations to thrive.\n\nIn summary, the news covers the Kardashev scale and its implications for advanced civilizations, the need for these civilizations to harvest energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible, the creation of the WARCZone collection by the Internet Archive, and the continued fascination with the concept of Dyson spheres in the search for intelligent life in the universe.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

He had no intention of making it a political program, but it eventually became one due to the political climate at the time.\n\nThe Daily Show's early format consisted of a monologue, interviews, and field pieces. The team worked tirelessly to create a unique and humorous take on the news. Craig Kilborn served as the initial host, but he left in 1998, and Stewart took over in 1999.\n\nUnder Stewart's leadership, The Daily Show became a cultural phenomenon. It tackled political issues with satire and humor, often criticizing both political parties and the media. The show's success can be attributed to its ability to engage viewers in a way that traditional news programs could not.\n\nThe Daily Show's impact on American politics and culture is significant. It helped to shape the political discourse and influenced a generation of young people to become more politically engaged. The show's success paved the way for other satirical news programs, such as The Colbert Report and Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.\n\nStewart's departure from The Daily Show in 2015 marked the end of an era. Trevor Noah took over as host, and the show continued to evolve and adapt to the changing political landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, The Daily Show under Jon Stewart's leadership revolutionized the way news was presented and consumed in America. It used satire and humor to engage viewers and critically analyze the political landscape, leaving a lasting impact on American culture and politics.", "answers": ["Jon Stewart took over as host of the Daily Show in January 1999, but when did the program truly start becoming the Daily Show that legions of fans would come to love?

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don’t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.) Carell: \"It was making fun of a gotcha moment.

{"pred": "\n\nThree new studies published in the journal Science challenge the traditional view that modern human behaviors such as toolmaking, innovation, and cultural advancements emerged suddenly around 40,000 years ago. Instead, the research suggests that these behaviors were present much earlier, around 300,000 years ago, in Africa.\n\nThe first study focuses on excavations in Kenya, where researchers discovered Homo heidelbergensis tools that are similar in age to those made by modern humans. These tools include stone flakes, cores, and blades, which were used for cutting, scraping, and piercing. The researchers argue that these tools indicate a level of technological sophistication and innovation that was previously thought to be unique to modern humans.\n\nThe second study also comes from Kenya and provides evidence of climate change around 300,000 years ago. The researchers suggest that this climate shift may have driven Homo heidelbergensis to adapt and innovate in order to survive. They propose that this period of environmental instability may have been a catalyst for the development of more complex social structures and cultural practices.\n\nThe third study, which comes from South Africa, provides evidence of symbolic behavior in Homo heidelbergensis. The researchers found beads made from ostrich eggs and shells, which were likely used for personal adornment or ritual purposes. This discovery challenges the notion that symbolic behavior was a uniquely human trait that emerged only with the advent of modern humans.\n\nTogether, these studies suggest that the so-called \"human revolution\" was not a sudden event but rather a gradual process that began much earlier than previously thought. They also challenge the Eurocentric view that modern human behaviors originated in Europe and support the idea that Africa was a cradle of human innovation and cultural development.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The partnership will provide United customers with more options for travel to Latin America and the Caribbean. The new agreement will allow United customers to earn and redeem miles on Copa Airlines and Copa Airlines Colombia flights.

His parents, David and Louise Sorkin, were thrilled with the outcome and described their son as being \"on cloud nine\" after the surgery.\n\nThe procedure involved harvesting cartilage from Kieran's ribs and shaping it into ears using a 3D printer. The ears were then attached to the sides of his head using screws and surgical glue. The surgery was a success, and Kieran's new ears were described as looking \"perfect\" by his father.\n\nThe creation of Kieran's ears marks a significant milestone in the field of plastic surgery and is expected to pave the way for similar procedures for other children born without ears or those who have lost their ears due to accidents or diseases. The surgery is not a cure for hearing loss, but it is hoped that the new ears will help Kieran feel more confident and accepted in society.\n\nKieran will undergo a follow-up surgery in six months to make his ears stand out more from his scalp. The new ears are expected to last a lifetime, as they are made from the boy's own tissue. The procedure cost around £25,000 and was funded by the hospital's charity.\n\nApproximately 100 children in the UK are born each year without ears, and this number is estimated to be around 3,000 worldwide. The condition, known as microtia, can also affect hearing, and some children with the condition require hearing aids or cochlear implants.

Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

According to a report published in Science, researchers have found strong isotopic anomalies in Martian water maps, indicating that early Mars had a global ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. This discovery challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry and arid planet.\n\nThe researchers used data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft to create maps of the Martian atmosphere's deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio. They found that the ratio was significantly higher in the polar regions than in the equatorial regions, indicating that water had once covered a vast area of the northern hemisphere. The team estimates that the ancient ocean was at least 130 meters deep, and early Mars may have had a global ocean that was 1.6 kilometers deep.\n\nFurthermore, a separate study published in the journal Science suggests that Mars had an ocean that covered about 40% of its northern hemisphere around 4 billion years ago. This ocean would have made Mars a more promising place for life to take hold. The researchers used data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to study the distribution of water ice in the Martian polar caps and found evidence of an ancient ocean.\n\nThese findings add to the growing body of evidence that Mars was once a wet and potentially habitable planet.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The court found that the shape does not have distinctive character, allowing Cadbury, a subsidiary of Mondelez, to continue selling its similar-shaped chocolate bars. The legal battle, which has been ongoing for over a decade, began when Nestlé attempted to register the shape as a trademark in 2002. The decision comes as a relief to Mondelez, which also owns Cadbury and the Leo bar, a four-finger chocolate treat. The ruling also affects other companies, such as Norway's Kvikk Stick, which has a similar shape and taste to Kit Kat. The case has been closely watched in the business world, as it sets a precedent for trademarking product shapes in the EU. The dispute has also been a topic of debate in the UK, with some expressing concern over the potential loss of a British icon. The court's decision was based on the fact that the shape of the Kit Kat bar is not distinctive enough to be protected as a trademark. The case is not over yet, as Nestlé can still appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice's Grand Chamber.

Contrary to the roaring and terrifying images portrayed in popular culture, new evidence suggests that some dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, producing quieter and more complex sounds.\n\nThe first study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocal abilities of modern birds and their ancestors, the dinosaurs. Researchers found that birds, which are descendants of dinosaurs, have the ability to produce a wide range of sounds using their syrinx, a complex vocal organ. They also discovered that some birds use closed-mouth vocalizations during mating displays, suggesting that this behavior may have been present in dinosaurs as well.\n\nThe second study, published in the journal Current Biology, focused on the T. rex, one of the most iconic dinosaurs. Using computer simulations, researchers modeled the T. rex's vocal tract and found that it was capable of producing a range of sounds, including low-pitched growls and high-pitched squeaks. They also suggested that the T. rex may have used closed-mouth vocalizations during mating displays, as some modern birds do.\n\nThe third study, published in the journal Science, provided evidence of closed-mouth vocalizations in dinosaurs by analyzing fossilized bird skulls. The researchers found that some bird skulls had unique structures that suggested the ability to produce closed-mouth sounds. They also argued that these structures were likely present in the dinosaurs that gave rise to birds.\n\nThe fourth study, published in the journal Evolution, looked at the evolution of vocalizations in archosaurs, a group that includes dinosaurs and their descendants, birds.

{"pred": "\n\nA new report published in the medical journal Lancet reveals that obesity is a growing problem worldwide, with nearly 3 billion people now either overweight or obese. The United States leads the world in obesity, with 13% of the global total, but other countries are also experiencing significant increases in obesity rates. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Washington-Seattle, found that obesity rates have been rising steadily over the past three decades, with no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe report paints a concerning picture of the global obesity epidemic, with obesity rates increasing in both rich and poor countries. Among the details, the study found that the number of obese people worldwide has more than doubled since 1980, and that obesity is now the fifth leading risk factor for death and disability.\n\nThe causes of obesity are complex and multifaceted, and the report does not attempt to provide a definitive answer. However, it does suggest that factors such as unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles, and environmental factors may be contributing to the problem. The report also notes that obesity is not just a health issue, but also a social and economic one, with significant costs to individuals, families, and societies.\n\nThe report calls for urgent action to address the global obesity epidemic, including policies to promote healthy diets and physical activity, as well as efforts to reduce the marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children. The World Health Organization has launched a commission to study the issue and develop solutions, and a report is expected in early 2015.\n\nIn the meantime, individuals can take steps to reduce their own risk of obesity, such as eating a healthy diet, getting regular physical activity, and avoiding sugary drinks and processed foods. By working together, we can help turn the tide on the global obesity epidemic and create a healthier, more sustainable future for ourselves and future generations.", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

Other countries, however, have even higher obesity rates, including Tonga, where more than 50% of all adults are obese. \"Two-thirds of the obese population actually resides in developing countries,\" says one of the researchers; they warn that obesity rates are rising among rich and poor countries, men and women, and adults and children alike."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1409}

In the elections, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafist Al-Nour Party were expected to make significant gains. Meanwhile, in the courtroom, the chief prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, accused Mubarak of imposing a \"tyrannical regime\" during his 30-year rule and called for the harshest possible sentence. Suleiman also accused Mubarak of corruption and abuse of power, and described him as a \"symbol of oppression and injustice.\" The trial, which began in August 2011, has been bogged down by procedural issues and delays. Mubarak, who is currently in detention, faces charges of complicity in the deaths of over 800 protesters during the 2011 uprising. The trial comes amid growing opposition to the military council's rule and calls for a swift transition to civilian government. The elections and the trial are taking place against the backdrop of a struggling economy, with high unemployment and inflation rates. The new parliament is expected to face the daunting task of addressing these economic challenges and implementing political reforms.
