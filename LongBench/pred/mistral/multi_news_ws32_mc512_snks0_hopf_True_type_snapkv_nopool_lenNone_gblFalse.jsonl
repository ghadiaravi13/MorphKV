In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

The reduction of the bond—once $1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings. \"With all due respect your honor, there's no evidence against him to show he's responsible for this,\" defense lawyer Jason Lamm said. \"He is no more the I-10 shooter than, respectfully, you are.\" Merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom. After the hearing, family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The shootings caused panic on Phoenix-area freeways, where 11 vehicles were hit in August and September. Detectives took Merritt into custody on Sept. 18; in court the next day, Merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars, telling the judge, \"I'm the wrong guy.\" His lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence, citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and involved 9,500 participants, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations over a five-year period had a 78% higher risk of developing new-onset diabetes compared to those with more stable weight. Additionally, they had a 46% higher risk of cardiovascular events and a 31% higher risk of all-cause mortality.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart become damaged or diseased due to the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, leading to decreased blood flow and oxygen to the heart. This can result in chest pain, heart attacks, and other complications.\n\nThe study builds on previous research linking yo-yo dieting to poor heart health. Yo-yo dieting, also known as weight cycling, is defined as repeated cycles of weight loss and weight gain. The exact mechanisms behind the link between yo-yo dieting and heart disease are not fully understood, but it is believed that the inflammation and oxidative stress caused by weight loss and regain may contribute to the development and progression of coronary artery disease.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends a healthy lifestyle to prevent and manage coronary artery disease, including a balanced diet, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco use.

With the storm set to make landfall the next day, Ricks knew he had one last chance to effectively communicate the severity of the situation to the public. Using bold language, he issued a warning that would become known as the most dire weather forecast in history. The document, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum, predicted widespread devastation, including the failure of \"most\" homes and the potential for water shortages. Ricks' forecast was vindicated when Hurricane Katrina struck, causing catastrophic damage to New Orleans and the surrounding areas. In an interview, Ricks reflected on the experience, expressing relief that he had been correct but also sadness for the human toll of the disaster.\n\nAt the time, Ricks was just one of many people working to prepare for the storm. Across the region, evacuations were underway and people were making last-minute preparations. In New Orleans, the Superdome was being used as a shelter, and meteorologists and emergency responders were doing all they could to get the word out about the impending disaster. Despite their best efforts, however, the response was not enough to prevent widespread suffering and loss.\n\nRicks' forecast was not the only bold statement made in the days leading up to Hurricane Katrina. Other meteorologists, including Gary Szatkowski, also used strong language to warn of the storm's potential impact. And in the years since, the National Weather Service has encouraged its meteorologists to use more forceful language in their forecasts during emergencies.\n\nThe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was a turning point for the National Weather Service and for emergency management more broadly.

However, when diagnosed at later stages, the five-year survival rate drops significantly.\n\nThe study's findings have important implications for public health. The American Cancer Society and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force are currently reviewing the evidence to determine if the age for colorectal cancer screening should be lowered. In the meantime, the study's authors recommend that people with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, such as a history of inflammatory bowel disease, consider talking to their healthcare provider about starting screening earlier.\n\nThe study also emphasizes the importance of raising awareness about colorectal cancer in younger adults. Many people mistakenly believe that colorectal cancer only affects older adults. However, the trend towards earlier diagnosis and treatment offers hope for those diagnosed at a younger age. With increased awareness and earlier detection, it is possible to improve outcomes and save lives.\n\nIn summary, the study highlights the increasing trend of colorectal cancer in younger adults and the importance of early detection and treatment.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

This concept, known as a Kardashev Scale civilization, was initially proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1964. Recently, astrophysicist Dan Hooper revived this idea, suggesting that advanced civilizations may need to harvest energy from their stars to prevent isolation and eventual extinction due to the natural expansion of the universe.\n\nSecond, the search for advanced alien civilizations continues, with scientists and researchers looking for signs of their existence in the vastness of space. One potential method involves searching for Dyson spheres, massive structures that could surround a star and capture a significant portion of its energy output. These structures could be indicative of advanced civilizations that have mastered the ability to harness and manipulate their star's energy.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internet Archive has made available a collection of documents related to the Warp Drive Concept Zone, which includes various theories and ideas about faster-than-light travel and the potential existence of advanced alien civilizations.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

According to one study, researchers measured isotopic maps of water on Mars and found evidence of great water loss, indicating that early Mars had a global layer of water. The maps also revealed that Mars had at least 13 times more water than it does now, which could have covered nearly half of the planet's surface. Another study revealed that a massive ancient ocean covered nearly half of Mars' northern hemisphere for millions of years. This ocean was discovered using data from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency's Mars Express Orbiter. The findings challenge the long-held belief that Mars was a dry and barren planet.\n\nThe evidence for ancient water on Mars comes from various sources, including geological features, mineral deposits, and atmospheric data. For instance, researchers have found signs of ancient riverbeds, lake beds, and deltas, which suggest that water once flowed freely on the planet's surface. Additionally, mineral deposits, such as clays and sulfates, which form in the presence of water, have been detected on Mars. Atmospheric data also indicates that Mars once had a thicker atmosphere, which could have retained more heat and allowed for the existence of liquid water.\n\nThe discovery of ancient water on Mars raises the possibility that the planet may have once harbored life. While there is no definitive evidence of life on Mars yet, the findings add to the growing body of evidence that the planet was once a much wetter and warmer world than it is today.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Through a groundbreaking experiment, they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos based on brain activity, providing a glimpse into the \"movies\" playing in our minds. The team, led by Jack Gallant, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure blood flow in the visual cortex of subjects as they watched YouTube videos. By analyzing the patterns of brain activity, they were able to determine which specific videos the subjects were watching.\n\nThe researchers then used this data to create a blurry, dream-like reconstruction of the videos based on the subjects' brain activity. This is the first time that researchers have been able to continuously reconstruct dynamic visual experiences from brain activity. While this technology is not yet advanced enough to read minds or see people's dreams, it is a major step towards understanding the complex visual processing that occurs in the brain.\n\nGallant and his team believe that this research could have important implications for fields such as neuroscience, computer science, and even law enforcement. For example, it could potentially be used to help people with paralysis communicate by imagining sequences of movements, or to help law enforcement reconstruct crime scenes based on eyewitness testimony.\n\nHowever, there are also ethical concerns surrounding the use of this technology. For instance, it could potentially be used to invade people's privacy or to manipulate their thoughts and memories. Gallant and his team are aware of these concerns and are working to address them through ongoing research and dialogue with experts in various fields.\n\nIn summary, the UC Berkeley team's groundbreaking research provides a fascinating glimpse into the inner workings of the human brain and opens up new possibilities for understanding and interacting with the world around us.

{"pred": "\n\nEgyptians went to the polls for the third day in a row on January 2, 2012, to vote in the final round of Egypt's parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, in a Cairo courtroom, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak resumed with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing a \"tyrant regime\" and branding him a \"corrupt leader.\" Mubarak, who is charged with complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the 2011 uprising, faces life in prison if convicted.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) and the Salafist Al-Nour Party are expected to win a significant number of seats. The final round of voting covers 13 governorates, including Cairo and Alexandria, where the largest number of seats are up for grabs. The elections have been marred by violence and irregularities, with reports of ballot stuffing, intimidation, and clashes between supporters of different parties.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, is being closely watched both domestically and internationally. The former president's trial is a reminder of the tumultuous events that have shaken Egypt since the start of the Arab Spring in 2010. The trial is also a test for Egypt's new military rulers, who have promised to bring those responsible for the deaths of protesters to justice.\n\nThe parliamentary elections are the first since the fall of Mubarak and are seen as a crucial step towards democratic transition in Egypt. The new parliament is expected to draft a new constitution and oversee the transition to civilian rule. However, the elections have been criticized for being dominated by Islamist parties, raising concerns about the future direction of Egypt's political landscape.\n\nThe economic situation in Egypt is also a cause for concern. The country's economy has been hit hard by the political instability and the tourism industry, a major source of revenue, has suffered significantly. The slowdown in economic growth has led to rising unemployment and inflation, adding to the challenges facing the new government.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak and the parliamentary elections are just two of the many challenges facing Egypt as it navigates its", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
