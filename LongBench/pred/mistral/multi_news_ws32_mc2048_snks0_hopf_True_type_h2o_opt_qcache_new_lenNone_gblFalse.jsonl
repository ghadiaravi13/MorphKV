Researchers Matteo Borrini of Liverpool John Moores University and Luigi Garlaschelli of the Italian Committee for the Investigation of Claims of the Pseudosciences conducted a bloodstain pattern analysis on the shroud, using both human and synthetic blood. Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the cloth are inconsistent with each other and cannot be explained by a body lying flat on the fabric. Instead, they propose that the shroud may be a representation of a standing model, casting doubt on its authenticity. The researchers used two types of blood to analyze the flow of blood on wounds on the left hand, forearms, torso, and waist. They found that the angles of the blood flow were inconsistent with the supposed position of the body on the shroud. For example, the blood trickles on the back of the hand occurred at a different angle when the arm was at a 45-degree angle than what is depicted on the shroud. Similarly, the spear wound bled in a direction consistent with the shroud image when the test subject was upright, but it formed rivulets rather than a solidly filled stain. The researchers were unable to replicate the lower back stain at all.

Researchers looking at the blood spatter found that the stains appeared to come from someone standing up, rather than someone who was flat on the fabric, Science Alert reports.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but are placed in institutions due to poverty or lack of local education and health facilities, especially for children with special needs.\n\nInstitutionalized children suffer from measurable and sometimes irreparable harm, including lack of education and physical or mental health issues, malnutrition, abuse, and trafficking. The effects on infants are particularly chronic, with many failing to thrive or dying.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not to make institutions more comfortable, but to eliminate them altogether. Lumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050 through investment in inclusive education and health, support for vulnerable families, and fostering, adoption, or other family-based care alternatives for children who cannot be with their parents.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this effort, as their funding choices and principles greatly influence the support available to children and families. The economic benefits of supporting a child in a family rather than an institution are significant, as these children are far less likely to become dependent in adulthood.\n\nLumos has seen success in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where there have been significant reductions in the number of children in institutions.

The house, which was not a permanent residence, was likely used for feasts and gatherings. The site, which includes a massive enclosure of 15 hectares, is believed to have been built for status and wealth display.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child was discovered. The child, wearing an amber necklace, was found in a foetal position. Scientific analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, diet, and date of burial, which may shed light on where the child lived.\n\nBoth sites are part of the Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum.

The dinosaur, which is about the size of a crow, had iridescent feathers that shimmered with rainbow colors. The discovery was made from a well-preserved fossil that included the dinosaur's skull, body, and feathers. The researchers used powerful microscopes to study the fossil and found that the feathers contained melanosomes, which are responsible for producing color in animals. The dinosaur's feathers were not only colorful but also asymmetrical, suggesting that they may have played a role in display or attracting mates. Caihong juji is the earliest known dinosaur with asymmetrical feathers and the first dinosaur with rainbow-colored feathers. The discovery challenges the previous belief that dinosaurs were drab and dull-colored creatures.

The dinosaur was classified as a theropod, a group of dinosaurs that includes birds and their closest relatives. It belonged to a subgroup of theropods called Maniraptora, which includes birds and their closest non-avian relatives. The researchers also compared the anatomy of Caihong juji with other known theropods and found that it had several unique features.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The second study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics, also found an association between prenatal exposure to acetaminophen and ADHD-like behavioral problems in children. However, the authors emphasized that their study did not prove that acetaminophen causes ADHD.\n\nBoth studies have received mixed reactions from experts. Some experts suggest that more studies are needed to confirm the findings and to determine the risk level. Others advise pregnant women to consider non-pharmacological methods for pain relief, such as massage, warm baths, and acupuncture. McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, stated that there is no definitive evidence linking acetaminophen use during pregnancy to ADHD.\n\nThe studies add to growing concerns about the safety of medications during pregnancy. Pregnant women are advised to consult their healthcare providers before taking any medication, including over-the-counter pain relievers, and to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. Non-pharmacological methods for pain relief, such as massage, warm baths, and acupuncture, are recommended as alternatives.\n\nIt's important to note that ADHD diagnoses have been on the rise, and more than 1 in 10 children have been diagnosed with the condition.

The House of Representatives passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, but the Senate is expected to reject it due to the inclusion of conditions related to the Affordable Care Act. House Speaker John Boehner is under pressure from conservative Republicans to delay or defund the health care law, but Senate Democrats and President Obama have made it clear they will not accept such changes. The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, leaving little time to reach a compromise before the deadline. A government shutdown could result in the suspension of services, the furloughing of hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and a potential economic impact on the Washington D.C. region. The economic impact could be particularly significant in the Washington D.C. area, where the concentration of federal workers and contractors is high. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against Republican efforts to delay or defund the Affordable Care Act and has urged President Obama to take a similar position. Reid believes that giving in to Republican demands on the short-term funding bill would set a dangerous precedent for future fiscal battles. The economic consequences of a government shutdown could be severe, with estimates suggesting that the Washington D.C. region could lose up to $200 million per day in economic activity. The impact on the broader economy could also be significant, with some estimates suggesting that a prolonged shutdown could reduce economic growth by 0.6 percentage points. The political consequences of a shutdown could also be significant, with both parties facing potential backlash from constituents.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The breach was caused by a type of malware that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The malware, which is new to eCrime, is highly sophisticated and covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers. The attackers are believed to be from Eastern Europe, and the trend of POS hacking is expected to continue due to the high rewards and low risk for cyber crooks.\n\nBoth investigations are ongoing, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both breaches to determine if they are related.

The incident sparked outrage on social media, with many calling it a senseless killing. In South Africa, a 3-year-old male lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park and was being hunted down by wildlife officials. The decision to kill or capture the lion was met with controversy, with some advocating for the lion's relocation rather than its death.\n\nThe incidents highlight the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. Last year, the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe by an American dentist caused an international outcry.\n\nIn the case of Mohawk, he had recently been involved in territorial fights and was trying to establish new territory when he strayed from Nairobi National Park. He was killed after injuring a man who had come to protect him from a crowd that had gathered to taunt and stone the lion.

The search for the lion was hampered by difficult terrain and windy conditions.\n\nThe incidents also raised questions about the use of tranquilizers to dart lions and return them to their habitats, versus the decision to kill them.

The planet is believed to be massive, with a mass between 10 and 20 times that of Earth, and its orbit is estimated to be at least 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune. The discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system and potentially provide new insights into its formation.\n\nMike Brown, the lead researcher, is no stranger to controversy in the world of planetary science. He gained notoriety a decade ago when he played a key role in the demotion of Pluto from planetary status. Brown and his team discovered Eris, a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, which is similar in size to Pluto. This discovery led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to redefine the definition of a planet, resulting in Pluto's demotion. Brown has since embraced the moniker \"Pluto Killer\" but insists that he is simply following the scientific evidence.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with several telescopes around the world currently scanning the night sky for any signs of the elusive planet.

NASA's Jim Green, the director of planetary science at the agency, has urged caution and emphasized the importance of rigorous scientific investigation. Green also expressed his personal excitement about the potential discovery and the implications it could have for our understanding of the solar system.\n\nIn related news, astronomers have also reported the discovery of a new exoplanet, located in the habitable zone of its star, which could potentially support life.

But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms.

Ricks came up with a bold and effective solution: a dire weather forecast warning of unprecedented destruction and human suffering. The forecast, which included statements like \"most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks, perhaps longer,\" and \"water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards,\" was issued the day before the storm made landfall. The forecast, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nRicks, who had lived through Hurricanes Betsy and Camille in the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, knew the potential damage all too well. He went through each statement in the forecast carefully, validating each one and refusing to take any out, despite the potential for criticism. His forecast was tragically accurate, and the images of devastation that followed made it clear that the storm had caused immense damage. Ricks and his colleagues at the National Weather Service were left to deal with the aftermath, many of them having lost their own homes in the storm. The experience left Ricks and his team heartbroken, but they had done everything in their power to warn the public of the impending disaster.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

The first article discusses a new paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, which revives the Kardashev scale, a theory proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1962 that categorizes civilizations based on their energy consumption. According to Hooper, advanced civilizations may need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving them isolated. This is due to the presence of dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that advanced civilizations could use to harness the energy of their star. This idea was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 and later popularized by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his novel \"Star Maker.\" Dyson spheres would consist of a swarm of satellites that surround a star and collect its energy. These structures have been a popular topic in science fiction and have been featured in works by Larry Niven, Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, and Larry Niven and Gregory Benford. While humans are currently at the lower end of the Kardashev scale, some scientists believe that there could be civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours that have already reached the advanced stages of energy consumption. These civilizations may be detectable through their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The oldest known hand axes, which were used by our ancestors in Kenya's Southern Rift Valley around 1.2 million years ago, have been found to be more advanced and diverse than previously believed. These tools, which were shaped like a tear drop and were great for chopping, were the Swiss army knife of the Stone Age, according to Rick Potts, director of the Human Origins Program at the Smithsonian Institution.\n\nAround 320,000 years ago, our ancestors in the same region began using smaller, more diverse stone tools, marking the beginning of the Middle Stone Age. This technological shift occurred much earlier than previously thought and was likely driven by long periods of stress from repeated earthquakes and climate changes, which forced early humans to partner up with neighboring communities to cope.\n\nThe new findings challenge the traditional view of a sudden human behavioral revolution around 50,000 years ago. Instead, they suggest that our ancestors were already advanced and innovative problem-solvers much earlier than previously believed. The studies also provide evidence of the earliest use of pigments and the extraction of pigments for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe discoveries were made at the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which is the only record of the last million years in Africa and the earliest documented Middle Stone Age in the continent. The researchers believe that human ancestors may have started developing these new technologies even earlier than 320,000 years ago.\n\nThe new findings also challenge the idea of a crude, early version of the Middle Stone Age and instead show that our ancestors had the ability to produce small, sharp tools for specific purposes. The diversity of stone tools from this period suggests advanced thinking and planning.\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of long-distance exchange of raw materials and pigments, indicating the early stages of social networks and the exchange of resources between different groups.\n\nOverall, the new studies provide important insights into early human behavior and technology in Africa and challenge previous assumptions about when and how these innovations occurred.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller explained the decision by using the word \"courage,\" stating that the company was moving on and doing something better for all of us. However, many people on Twitter mocked Schiller's statement, comparing it to real acts of courage such as the Selma march or facing down tanks in Tiananmen Square.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has sparked controversy, with some arguing that it is a technological regression and an example of Apple's hubris, arrogance, or even stupidity. The loss of the headphone jack means that users can no longer use wired headphones or charge their phones at the same time. Apple is instead promoting its proprietary wireless solutions, such as the AirPods and Lightning EarPods. However, many people prefer the sound quality of wired headphones and are skeptical of the benefits of wireless technology.\n\nThe decision to remove the headphone jack also has implications beyond just audio. Many other devices, such as temperature sensors and personal breathalyzers, plug into the phone's headphone jack. Apple's move may force users to purchase expensive dongles or adaptors to use these devices with the new iPhone models.\n\nSchiller also mentioned that space was a premium inside the iPhone and that Apple wanted to include stereo speakers and Taptic engines instead of keeping the headphone jack. However, some have criticized this reasoning, arguing that most iPhone users are unlikely to be familiar with Taptic engines and that the headphone jack was a standard feature that worked with any set of headphones, regardless of age or brand.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack is just one of several changes to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. Other features include a water-resistant design, improved cameras, and the removal of the 16GB storage option.

The airline has updated its boarding process to reduce congestion and speed up loading by using fewer boarding lanes and implementing a new color-coded system for priority boarding. Elite and priority passengers, as well as Chase co-branded credit card holders, will board first through lane 1, while all other customers will use lane 2. The new process is expected to help alleviate the problem of idle, standing passengers near the gate, especially during delays. In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app, allowing them to be notified when boarding starts.\n\nSeparately, United has announced a joint business agreement (JBA) with Copa and Avianca, pending government approval, which is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. The carriers plan to offer integrated, seamless service in more than 12,000 city pairs, new nonstop routes, additional flights, reduced travel times, and a more streamlined travel experience. The JBA is expected to drive economic benefits and traffic growth at major gateway cities coast to coast.\n\nThe changes come as the airline industry continues to experiment with ways to improve the boarding process and provide better customer experiences. Several years ago, United started using five lanes for boarding, but this created idle, standing passengers near the gate, especially during delays. The new strategy launched this week helps alleviate that problem. United's competitors, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, already use similar boarding processes. However, United's top tier elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts, while most carriers only offer this perk to VIP passengers.\n\nThe new boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week.

{"pred": "\n\nJamaica's parliament passed historic legislation on Tuesday, decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana and paving the way for a medical cannabis industry on the island. The new law makes possession of up to 2oz (56.6g) of marijuana a petty offense, eliminating the need for a criminal record. Cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises is now permitted. The legislation also establishes a licensing authority to regulate cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Rastafarians can legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time on the island, and tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad can apply for permits to buy small amounts. Peter Bunting, Jamaica's national security minister, emphasized that the law does not create a free-for-all for growing, transporting, dealing, or exporting marijuana, and the security forces will continue to enforce Jamaican law. The US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics affairs, William Brownfield, acknowledged Jamaica's sovereign decision but reminded that trafficking of marijuana into the US remains illegal. The move comes after decades of debate and is seen as an opportunity for Jamaica to become a player in the medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative marijuana-derived items. Jamaica's commerce minister, Anthony Hylton, expressed optimism about the industry's potential for economic growth. The new law adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use, with more than 20 US states allowing some form of medical marijuana and three US states legalizing recreational use. In the Americas, Uruguay became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market, and Argentina decriminalized personal possession under a 2009 supreme court ruling.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

{"pred": "\n\nRecent studies suggest that Mars once had a significant amount of water on its surface, making it a potentially habitable planet. According to a team of scientists at NASA and the European Southern Observatory, an ancient ocean covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making it a more promising place for alien life to have existed. The ocean was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, which is more than the Arctic Ocean holds today.\n\nThe evidence for this ancient ocean comes from studying the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the Martian atmosphere. Deuterium is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, and when normal water is lost to space, the concentration of deuterium in the remaining water increases. By measuring the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the Martian atmosphere, scientists can infer how much water has been lost over time. The higher the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, the more water has been lost.\n\nThe infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere show that water near the polar ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. However, it is believed that the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean adds to the growing body of evidence that Mars was a warm and wet planet in its youth. This view radically rewrites what scientists believed only a decade ago, when it was widely considered that flowing water was a more erratic presence on Mars and that long-standing seas and oceans did not exist.\n\nThe search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian surface. The discovery of this ancient ocean increases the likelihood that Mars was once habitable, though it does not guarantee that life existed there.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean.

Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs likely made closed-mouth vocalizations, similar to the coos and mumbles of modern birds. This theory is based on the analysis of vocalizations in various archosaur species, including birds and crocodiles, and the assumption that similar vocal abilities could have evolved in dinosaurs.\n\nThe study suggests that large-bodied dinosaurs may have sounded like today's large-bodied birds, such as ostriches or emus, which make low, throaty sounds. This contradicts the popular image of dinosaurs roaring like the T. rex in movies such as Jurassic Park.\n\nGary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on Jurassic Park, revealed in an interview that many of the dinosaur sounds in the film were created by combining sounds from various animals, including tortoises, horses, and even human voices. For instance, the velociraptors' bark was inspired by the mating calls of tortoises, while the T. rex's roar was a combination of various animal sounds, including an elephant and a bear.\n\nThe researchers also suggest that the discovery of closed-mouth vocalizations in dinosaurs could provide insights into their behavior and social structures. For example, closed-mouth vocalizations could have been used for mating displays or communication between members of a herd.\n\nDespite the new findings, it is important to note that vocal organs do not fossilize, making it impossible to know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like.

The deal would also mark the triumph of electronic trading over traditional floor trading and the continued push by exchanges to embrace new technologies.\n\nBoth stories highlight the shift in the financial industry towards derivatives trading and the growing importance of electronic platforms. ICE, which was founded in 2000 and is based in Atlanta, competes fiercely with the CME Group, a derivatives trading powerhouse.

Bayesian methods have been successful in past search operations, including the hunt for Air France Flight 447 in 2009.\n\nBayesian inference is a statistical method that allows hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any given location based on new information. It is particularly useful in search operations where the target's location is uncertain and new information is constantly being gathered.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian methods are being used to assess the probability that the plane crashed due to an accident or as a result of a deliberate act. New information, such as data on the plane's communication systems, has led investigators to revise their estimates of the probability of different explanations.\n\nBayesian inference formalizes the process of assessing probabilities and updating them based on new information. It is based on the principle that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities. The method requires the initial estimation of a probability, which can be updated as new information becomes available.\n\nThe Air France Flight 447 search operation, which used Bayesian methods, was successful in locating the wreckage of the plane in the Atlantic Ocean two years after it disappeared. The search was challenging due to the large search area and the need to account for the effects of ocean currents on the debris.\n\nThe use of Bayesian methods in the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 search operation is complex due to the additional dimension of the cause of the disappearance. The probability of finding the plane in any given location depends on the probability that it crashed due to an accident or as a result of a deliberate act.\n\nDespite the challenges, advocates of Bayesian methods argue that they are valuable in bringing discipline to the search process and making it more effective.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This means that the second full moon of the month, also known as a Blue Moon, will be a Supermoon, which is when the moon is at its closest point to Earth, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon. Additionally, it will be a total lunar eclipse, during which the moon passes through the Earth's shadow, causing it to turn a reddish color. This unique combination of phenomena hasn't occurred for over 150 years.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project, an Italian organization, will be broadcasting the event live online, partnering with astrophotographers from around the world, including Australia, the United States, and Europe. The live session is scheduled to start at 11:30 UT on January 31, 2018. The organization will also be showing the Supermoon rising above Rome's legendary monuments later in the day.\n\nThe eclipse will be visible from various parts of the world, including Central and Eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and most of Australia. Heading farther west, parts of Western Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe will also get a view of the eclipse as the moon rises. In North America, Alaska, Hawaii, and northwestern Canada will see the entire eclipse, while the rest of North America will only see the beginning or end of it, depending on their location.\n\nThe last total lunar eclipse of a Blue Moon occurred on March 31, 1866. The next one won't happen until December 31, 2037. So, this is a rare opportunity to witness this unique astronomical event.\n\nIf you're unable to go outside and view the eclipse, you can still catch it live online through the Virtual Telescope Project's broadcast. And if you're an astrophotographer, you might want to consider joining their team and contributing to their efforts.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project is also offering a fundraiser for supporters, which includes limited edition images of the event. You can donate and receive these images by visiting their website.\n\nSo mark your", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years. For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.
