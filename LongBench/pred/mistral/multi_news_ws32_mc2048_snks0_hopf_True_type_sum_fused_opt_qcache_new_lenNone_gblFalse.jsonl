This has raised privacy concerns, as the device will be constantly connected to the internet and could potentially be vulnerable to hacking. Microsoft has stated that the Kinect is only listening for specific cues, such as \"Xbox On,\" but some users have expressed unease about the potential for the device to be always listening and recording.\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft have a history of privacy concerns related to their devices.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent and cannot be explained by a single pose or position of a crucified body.\n\nThe researchers found that the forearm rivulets, hand marks, and chest wound patterns did not match up with each other or with the angles depicted on the shroud. They also discovered that a simulated spear wound in the chest ran in different patterns whether the test subject was standing or lying down, contradicting the image on the shroud.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the bloodstains on the shroud appear to be patched together from a standing model, adding to evidence that the cloth is a medieval forgery.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The opposition was led by the proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, which recommended shareholders vote against the pay package. The company's compensation was based on its safety record, financial performance compared to peers, and the clean-up efforts following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. However, some investors argued that the pay was out of line with the company's poor financial performance and the industry's low oil prices. This was the first time in living memory that a top British company faced a rebellion over executive pay. The vote was non-binding, but it sent a strong message to the company and its leadership.

The vote results were announced at BP's annual general meeting in London, where several shareholders publicly criticized the pay decision.

The trail, which stretches from California to Washington, has a long history of fewer than 3,000 people completing the entire hike in a year. However, the recent influx of hikers has led to concerns about overcrowding, environmental damage, and financial strain on essential services.\n\nThe PCT is a fragile ecosystem, and deserts, in particular, are susceptible to damage from hikers. The U.S. Forest Service volunteer Jules Fijolek emphasizes the importance of protecting the desert environments and the potential need for shelters and other infrastructure if damage becomes significant. The permit system, which limits the number of hikers to 50 per day, was introduced in 2015 to mitigate the impact on the trail and the environment.\n\nThe financial burden of accommodating the increased number of hikers falls on essential services, such as helicopter evacuations and searches. The cost of these services has already exceeded $20,000 in rescues by April 2016. The honor system is currently the only means of enforcing the permit system, and concerns have been raised about its effectiveness in managing the growing number of hikers.\n\nThe PCT community has been discussing the issue of increased numbers and pressures for over a decade.

Its body was covered in feathers, some of which were preserved with melanin pigment, suggesting that the dinosaur had colorful plumage. The discovery of Caihong juji provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and their potential functions in dinosaurs.\n\nThe dinosaur's fossilized remains were found in Hebei Province, northeastern China, by a local farmer.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

He also noted that the image on the smartphone app would not have been as detailed as on a proper map and that the light boots worn by Jane were not suitable for such rough terrain. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death. Chris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Rescue team, described the route as \"not a straightforward path\" and advised walkers to use a map and compass in addition to electronic navigation aids due to potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map and the possibility of batteries running out.

The tax also leaves out sugar-sweetened beverages sold in bulk or at restaurants, making it an inconsistent policy. The tax has been repealed in Cook County, Illinois, due to public outcry and negative economic impact. Seattle's tax is particularly burdensome, with a case of Gatorade costing over $20 before tax and nearly $30 after tax.

The tax is expected to generate $15 million in revenue for the city, which will be used for community college tuition and other projects.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The first study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The researchers cautioned that this does not mean that taking acetaminophen once will cause ADHD, but advised pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use.\n\nThe second study, also published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark and found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD-like behavioral problems. However, the study did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nBoth studies have received mixed reactions from experts. Some believe that the findings warrant further investigation, while others caution against jumping to conclusions. The American Academy of Pediatrics currently recommends acetaminophen as the safest pain reliever for pregnant women, but some researchers suggest that it may interfere with maternal hormones critical for fetal brain development.\n\nAcetaminophen is widely used during pregnancy due to its mild effects and availability over the counter. However, it is not without risks. Large doses can damage the liver, and the Food and Drug Administration has asked drug companies to limit the amount in their products.\n\nAlternatives to acetaminophen for pain relief during pregnancy include massages, baths, and acupuncture.

The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, leaving little time to reach a compromise before the deadline.\n\nThe impact of a government shutdown would be significant, particularly in the Washington D.C. area, which is home to a large concentration of federal workers and contractors. An estimated $200 million in economic activity could be lost each day, and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. Federal services such as trash collection, library services, and processing of new benefits applications could be halted.

The mission, which is set to launch in summer 2018, will be the first to directly study a star and will provide insights into solar activity and space weather. The spacecraft will travel closer to the sun than any other human-made object, reaching speeds of up to 430,000 miles per hour. The mission aims to answer long-standing questions about the sun, including why the solar wind varies and what drives solar flares and coronal mass ejections. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its effects on the solar system. The mission was previously known as the Solar Probe Plus. Parker, who is still alive, was instrumental in predicting the existence of the solar wind and the solar magnetic field. He put forward the idea of solar wind in 1958, and his theories were later confirmed by Mariner 2, the first spacecraft to encounter Venus. The mission's primary science goals include tracing the structure and dynamics of the solar wind and its interaction with the magnetic field, studying the solar wind at the source, and understanding the causes of space weather.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The researchers have not yet directly observed the planet but have identified its potential presence based on the unusual orbits of several distant Kuiper Belt objects.\n\nBrown gained notoriety in 2006 when he led the team that discovered Eris, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, which led to the demotion of Pluto from its status as a planet. He has since embraced the nickname \"Pluto killer\" and has written a book about the discovery. Brown and Batygin believe that the existence of Planet Nine could help explain the unusual orbits of certain Kuiper Belt objects and provide new insights into the formation of our solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has renewed interest in the debate over the definition of a planet and the status of Pluto. Some scientists argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet due to its unique characteristics and historical significance. However, Brown and others maintain that the definition of a planet should be based on its orbit and size, and that Pluto does not meet these criteria.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with several telescopes around the world currently being used to observe the sky in the hope of detecting the elusive planet. If and when it is discovered, it is expected to provide valuable insights into the structure and evolution of our solar system.\n\nMeanwhile, Pluto continues to be a subject of fascination and controversy, with some scientists and the public still advocating for its reinstatement as a planet. The New Horizons spacecraft, which conducted a flyby of Pluto in 2015, has provided new data and images of the dwarf planet, shedding new light on its geology and composition.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes.

NASA reported that a pump on one of the station's external cooling loops had shut down due to a temperature limit being reached. The situation did not pose an immediate danger to the crew, but it did necessitate a reduction in normal operations on the space station. Engineers suspect a malfunctioning flow control valve may be the cause of the problem, and teams are working to determine whether a software fix or a spacewalk will be necessary to resolve the issue.\n\nThe second news story provided context and background information on the ISS and its cooling systems. The ISS is a collaborative project between 16 nations, and it has been continuously occupied since 2000. The station's six-person crew consists of NASA astronauts Mike Hopkins and Rick Mastracchio, Russians Mikhail Tyurin, Sergey Ryazansky, and Oleg Kotov, and Koichi Wakata of Japan. The ISS relies on two external cooling loops to circulate ammonia and keep equipment cool. In the past, NASA has conducted emergency spacewalks to repair cooling system issues.\n\nThe ISS's current mission, Expedition 38, is scheduled to last until March 2014. The space station's life support system remains operational, and non-critical systems have been shut down as a precaution. NASA has made significant progress in resolving the spacesuit problem that Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano faced during a July spacewalk. The agency is now cleared for contingency spacewalks if necessary.\n\nThe ISS is an impressive feat of international cooperation and engineering, and it continues to serve as a vital research platform for scientists and astronauts from around the world.

This trend is expected to continue, with nearly one in four rectal tumors and more than one in ten colon cancers being diagnosed in people under 50 by 2030.\n\nYounger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer due to the absence or dismissal of symptoms. Common symptoms include anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits.

The tools include the earliest known use of ochre in Australia, and the bones show evidence of butchery and cooking. The charcoal has been dated using the uranium-series method, which provides a more accurate age estimate than previous radiocarbon dating methods.\n\nThe discovery also provides new insights into the early human diet in Australia. The researchers found evidence of the consumption of emu, kangaroo, and wallaby, as well as plants such as grasses and tubers. This suggests that early humans in Australia were adaptable to a wide range of environments and were able to exploit a diverse range of food sources.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi also sheds new light on the relationship between Aboriginal people and the land. The site contains evidence of Aboriginal art and ritual practices, including the use of ochre for body painting and the creation of rock art. This suggests that Aboriginal people have been connected to the land for much longer than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is significant because it challenges the dominant narrative of Australian prehistory, which has been shaped by European settlers and their interpretations of the land. The discovery highlights the importance of Indigenous knowledge and the need to recognize the deep connection between Aboriginal people and the land.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi also has implications for our understanding of human evolution and the spread of modern humans around the world. The site provides evidence of the early adaptation of humans to new environments and the development of new technologies and cultural practices.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is a reminder of the rich history and cultural heritage of Australia and the importance of preserving and protecting Indigenous knowledge and cultural practices. It also highlights the need for ongoing research and collaboration between Indigenous communities and scientists to deepen our understanding of the past and the present.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News. Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

According to Hooper, as the universe expands, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To prevent this, advanced civilizations may capture and harvest stars from other galaxies, using them as a source of energy. This concept is based on Nikolai Kardashev's three types of technologically advanced civilizations, which include Type I, II, and III. Type I civilizations harness all the resources of a planet, Type II civilizations harness all the energy of a star, and Type III civilizations harness all the energy of a galaxy.\n\nThe second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that advanced civilizations could use to harness the energy of their star. This concept was first proposed by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\" and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in a scientific paper in 1960. Dyson spheres would consist of a swarm of satellites surrounding a star, collecting and beaming its energy back to the home planet. However, practical Dyson spheres would likely be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, rather than a solid shell around the star.\n\nBoth articles highlight the importance of energy consumption in advanced civilizations and the potential methods they may use to harness it.

However, many critics and consumers took to social media to express their disappointment and mock Schiller's use of the word \"courage.\"\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been met with criticism for several reasons. First, there is no clear technological advantage to removing the jack. Wired headphones generally provide better sound quality than wireless ones. Additionally, the new AirPods wireless headphones, which Apple is promoting as a replacement for wired headphones, have received mixed reviews for their design and functionality.\n\nAnother concern is the inconvenience and cost of the transition to wireless headphones. Many people have expressed frustration at having to purchase new headphones or dongles to use their existing headphones with the new iPhone models. Some have also criticized Apple for its decision as being driven by greed, given the expected sales of the $159 AirPods and the $9 dongles.\n\nFurthermore, the removal of the headphone jack has implications beyond just audio. Many other devices, such as temperature sensors and credit card readers, use the headphone jack for connectivity. Apple's decision to remove the jack means that these devices will no longer be compatible with the latest iPhone models.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack is not the only controversial decision Apple made at the event. Schiller also stated that the decision was made due to a lack of space inside the iPhone, despite the fact that many regular iPhone users may not even be aware of what a Taptic engine is.\n\nOverall, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been met with a mixed reaction.

Cultivation of five or fewer plants is now permitted, and a licensing authority will be established to regulate cultivation and distribution for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Rastafarians can legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time on the island where the spiritual movement was founded. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad will be able to apply for permits to legally buy small amounts of \"ganja.\"\n\nThe passage of this legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. Peter Bunting, the island's national security minister, said the security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations. William Brownfield, the US assistant secretary of state for international narcotics and law enforcement affairs, noted that the trafficking of marijuana into the US remains illegal.\n\nThe move to decriminalize marijuana adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on the drug for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and in 2014, Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. Elsewhere in the Americas, Uruguay became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market in 2014, and Argentina decriminalized personal possession in 2009.\n\nThe new law is significant because it begins to correct decades of criminalizing tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a small amount of marijuana. It also ends the victimization of Rastafarians, whose religion includes the ritualistic use of marijuana. The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.\n\nThe details of Jamaica's licensing authority and its hoped-for medical marijuana sector will need to be refined in coming months.

The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, hopes that this ruling could lead to the release of the chimpanzees and could influence other judges to do the same for other research animals. However, some legal experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, as the judge may simply want more information before making a decision on the legal personhood claim. The case began in December 2013, when the group petitioned three lower court judges with a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of four New York chimpanzees, arguing that they were too cognitively complex to be held in captivity. The judges quickly dismissed the cases, and the group has been appealing ever since.

The ocean, which was a mile deep, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This new finding challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only occasionally and never forming long-standing seas and oceans.\n\nThe evidence for the ancient ocean comes from atmospheric maps of water and its deuterated form, which reveal strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment. These maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 times the standard mean ocean water (VSMOW), suggesting that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe scientists used three of the most powerful infrared telescopes in the world to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules varied from place to place over the changing seasons. The higher concentration of deuterated water indicates that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen polar caps.\n\nThe ocean likely lasted for millions of years but eventually receded and froze due to the thinning atmosphere and the loss of insulation. Today, only 13% of the water remains, locked up in the polar ice caps. The discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars adds to the emerging picture of the planet as a warm and wet world in its youth, with long-standing lakes, streams, and deltas.\n\nThe search for life on Mars will continue in 2018 with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will look for chemical signatures of life, possibly emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Previous findings, such as the detection of methane in the Martian atmosphere, have sparked speculation about the possibility of life on Mars.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This means that the moon will be at its closest point to Earth (a Supermoon), it will be the second full moon in a month (a Blue Moon), and it will undergo a total lunar eclipse. The Virtual Telescope Project, led by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, will be livestreaming this event from various locations around the world, including Australia and Rome. The eclipse will be visible from Australia, western USA, and some parts of eastern Asia. Central and eastern Asia, as well as most of the Americas, will see the Supermoon rising above their respective cities. This event is quite rare, as the last time a total lunar eclipse occurred during a Blue Moon and a Supermoon was over 150 years ago. The eclipse will begin at 11:48 am UTC and reach its maximum at 1:31 pm UTC. For those unable to go outside and view the event, the Virtual Telescope Project will be providing a livestream. To capture the best images of the Supermoon or the lunar eclipse, it is recommended to use a smartphone or a DSLR camera and adjust the focus and exposure accordingly. The moon will appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon during this trilogy of supermoons.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
