{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as city officials in both cities set deadlines for protesters to leave. In Philadelphia, about 100 Occupy Philly protesters remained at City Hall, defying Mayor Michael Nutter's order to vacate the premises by 5 p.m. on Sunday. The protesters, who have been camped out at City Hall since October, were expecting to be evicted but were met with silence from city officials late into the evening. Police looked on as protesters chanted slogans and served soup to each other. Mayor Nutter's spokesman, Mark McDonald, stated that the city was expecting protesters to leave but would not speculate on when or if they would use force to remove them.\n\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to leave City Hall by 1 a.m. on Monday. The protesters, who have been camped out at City Hall since October, had defied a previous deadline to leave by midnight on Sunday. The standoff between police and protesters lasted for hours, with no arrests reported. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) had initially planned to clear the area peacefully but ultimately declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse.\n\nBoth protests are part of the larger Occupy Wall Street movement, which began in New York City in September and has since spread to cities across the United States. The movement aims to bring attention to economic inequality and corporate influence on government. In Los Angeles, at least 2,000 protesters had gathered by Sunday night, and in Philadelphia, about 100 remained at City Hall.\n\nMayor Nutter has stated that the city needs to renovate City Hall's front lawn and that the Occupy Philly protest is preventing this work from being done. In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has given protesters until midnight on Monday to leave City Hall. If they do not comply, the LAPD has said it will use force to remove them.\n\nThe Occupy protests have garnered support from celebrities and politicians alike. Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons tweeted to Mayor N", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morningâ€”though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
