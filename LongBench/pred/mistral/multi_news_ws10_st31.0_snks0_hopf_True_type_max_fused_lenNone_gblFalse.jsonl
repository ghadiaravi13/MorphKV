{"pred": "\n\nTwo studies led by researchers at the University of California, San Diego have revealed that cigarette smoke not only harms human health but also fuels the growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and strengthens the virulence of these bacteria. The studies, published in the journal Infection and Immunity and Infection and Immunity Reports, respectively, show that cigarette smoke enhances the ability of MRSA to invade human cells and resist antibiotics.\n\nPassage 1 focuses on the first study, which was led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander and her team. They discovered that cigarette smoke exposure increases the production of a protein called MRSA-associated collagen-binding protein (MSCBP) in human lung cells. This protein helps MRSA attach to and invade the cells more effectively. Additionally, cigarette smoke exposure weakens the immune response of the lung cells, making it harder for the body to fight off MRSA infections.\n\nPassage 2 discusses the second study, which was led by Dr. Shu-Fang Wang and her team. They found that cigarette smoke enhances the expression of virulence genes in MRSA, making the bacteria more resistant to antibiotics and more harmful to human cells. The researchers also noted that the smoke-exposed MRSA bacteria were more likely to form biofilms, which are protective layers that shield bacteria from antibiotics and the immune system.\n\nBoth studies emphasize the importance of avoiding cigarette smoke to reduce the risk of MRSA infections and complications. The researchers hope that their findings will lead to new strategies for preventing and treating MRSA infections, particularly in populations that are heavily exposed to cigarette smoke, such as healthcare workers and patients in hospitals.\n\nIn related news, a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity found that MRSA infections are more common and severe in smokers than in non-smokers. The study, led by Dr. Jianhua Zhang of the University of California, Davis, showed that smokers had higher levels of MRSA in their lungs and were more likely to develop pneumonia and other complications when infected with the bacteria.

The bird, which lived during the Miocene epoch, has been named Circaetus gallicus. The bird had a wingspan of around 2 meters and was similar in size to the modern-day African vulture.

Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The second study, published in the journal JAMA Network Open, suggested that acetaminophen use during pregnancy may increase the risk of asthma in children.\n\nThe JAMA Pediatrics study analyzed data from over 145,000 children born in Denmark between 1996 and 2016. Researchers found that children whose mothers took acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD or autism spectrum disorder than those whose mothers did not take the drug. However, the study did not prove causation, and the authors noted that other factors, such as genetics and environmental exposures, could also contribute to the development of these conditions.\n\nThe second study, which was based on data from over 100,000 children in the United States, found that children whose mothers took acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely to develop asthma or wheezing by age 7.

Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

{"pred": "\nNASA's upcoming mission to explore the sun, named Parker Solar Probe, is set to launch in the summer of 2018. The spacecraft, which will be the closest human-made object to the sun, is named after solar physicist Eugene Parker, who first proposed the existence of solar wind in 1958. The probe aims to answer fundamental questions about the sun's outer layers, including its magnetic fields and solar wind acceleration. The mission is a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA).\n\nIn related news, NASA has announced the renaming of its upcoming solar mission, now known as the Parker Solar Probe. The spacecraft will be launched on a Delta IV Heavy rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The mission is expected to provide crucial data on solar activity and space weather, which could help protect satellites and astronauts in space.\n\nAdditionally, NASA has revealed that the Parker Solar Probe will carry a suite of instruments from the ESA, including the Solar Probe Analyzer Telescope (SOLAR) and the Integrated Science Investigation of Magnetized Clouds (ISIMC) instrument. These instruments will help scientists better understand the sun's magnetic fields and how they interact with the solar wind.\n\nFurthermore, NASA has announced that the Parker Solar Probe will be the first mission to use a new heat shield technology, which will protect the spacecraft from the intense heat of the sun. The shield, made of carbon composite material, will maintain a temperature of around 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius) on the side facing the sun.\n\nLastly, NASA has revealed that the Parker Solar Probe will make 24 close passes through the sun's corona over the course of its mission, which is expected to last for seven years. Each pass will bring the spacecraft closer to the sun than any previous mission, allowing it to gather unprecedented data on solar activity and space weather.\n\nOverall, the Parker Solar Probe mission represents a significant step forward in our understanding of the sun and its impact on space. The mission's findings could help scientists better predict and mitigate the effects of solar activity on Earth and other planets in our solar system.", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The Neiman Marcus breach, which occurred as far back as July, was not disclosed to the public until late December. Hackers gained access to customer information, including names, addresses, and credit card numbers. The company initially downplayed the severity of the breach, but it was later revealed that the attack lasted for several months and affected an estimated 1.1 million customers.\n\nThe Target breach, which was disclosed in December, affected around 40 million customers in the United States and 70 million worldwide. Hackers stole credit and debit card information, as well as personal data such as names and addresses. The breach was traced back to a malware attack on Target's payment system.\n\nBoth breaches are believed to be part of a larger cybercrime campaign, as investigators have linked the attacks to the same hacking group. The malware used in the Target breach was also used in attacks on other retailers, including Neiman Marcus and Michaels.\n\nThe iSight Group, a computer security firm, released a report detailing the findings of their investigation into the Target breach. The report revealed that the hackers gained access to Target's system by exploiting a vulnerability in the company's HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) system. The hackers then installed malware on the company's point-of-sale (POS) system, allowing them to steal customer data.\n\nThe Target breach is believed to be the largest retail data breach in history, surpassing the 2007 TJX breach, which affected around 45 million customers. The Neiman Marcus breach is also significant, as it occurred earlier in the year and may have gone unnoticed for several months.\n\nBoth companies have faced criticism for their handling of the breaches. Target has faced particular scrutiny, as the breach occurred during the holiday shopping season, a time when the company was expected to see high sales volumes.

But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and involved 9,500 participants, found that those who experienced the greatest weight fluctuations had a 50% higher risk of cardiovascular events and a 31% higher risk of death compared to those with stable weight.\n\nCoronary artery disease is a condition in which the major blood vessels that supply the heart become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of cholesterol and other substances, leading to chest pain, shortness of breath, and heart attacks. The condition can be prevented and managed through lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and avoiding tobacco use.\n\nYo-yo dieting, also known as weight cycling, can lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and changes in the heart and blood vessels, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke. Previous studies have also linked yo-yo dieting to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, and gallstones.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, a cardiologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, said that the findings highlight the importance of maintaining a stable weight over the long term. \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off,\" he said. \"Our data suggest that weight cycling may be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and death, and that people should focus on sustainable weight loss strategies.\"\n\nThe study also found that people with a history of weight cycling were more likely to regain weight after losing it, and that those who gained weight back quickly had a higher risk of cardiovascular events and death.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Marketing chief Phil Schiller introduced the new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which were thinner and water-resistant, but lacked a standard headphone jack. Schiller explained that the space saved by removing the jack would be used to make the phones more water-resistant and thinner.\n\nThe removal of the headphone jack sparked a heated debate online, with many expressing their frustration and disappointment. Some saw it as a money-grabbing move by Apple, while others saw it as a necessary step towards a wireless future.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of the decision was a long-time Apple attendee and journalist, who has been to every Apple keynote since 1999.

Two separate research teams have made significant discoveries regarding Mars' water history.\n\nThe first team, led by Nasa scientists, used atmospheric data and maps of water isotopes to determine that Mars once had a deep, ancient ocean covering around 30% of the planet's surface. They also found that the Martian polar ice caps contain large amounts of water that could potentially be extracted for future human exploration.\n\nThe second team, led by researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, analyzed data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and discovered evidence of ancient riverbeds and lake basins, further supporting the theory that Mars had a large body of water in its past.\n\nAdditionally, a separate study revealed that Mars may have had a thicker atmosphere in the past, which could have helped maintain a warmer climate and support the existence of liquid water. This theory is based on the discovery of large quantities of methane and other gases in the Martian atmosphere, which could only have been produced by biological or geological processes in a warmer climate.\n\nThese findings add to the growing body of evidence that Mars once had the conditions necessary to support life, and increase the chances that future exploration missions will discover signs of past or present microbial life on the planet.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The researchers used computer simulations to model the dinosaur's vocal tract and found that the T. rex's vocal cords would have been too thick to produce a roar like modern large animals.\n\nFurthermore, a new study published in the journal \"Biology Letters\" suggests that some dinosaurs might have had feathers, challenging the traditional view of dinosaurs as scaly creatures.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The NYSE, which has been a symbol of stock market trading for over two centuries, is now primarily attractive due to its derivatives business, which includes the Liffe and NYSE Euronext exchanges.\n\nThe NYSE's potential acquisition by ICE comes after a series of failed mergers and consolidation efforts in the exchange industry. The NYSE had previously attempted to merge with Deutsche Börse in 2011, but the deal was called off due to regulatory concerns. The NYSE's parent company, NYSE Euronext, had also considered merging with NASDAQ OMX Group in 2011, but that deal was abandoned as well.\n\nThe second news story involves the decline of traditional stock trading in favor of derivatives trading.

A source tells UK magazine Look the actor sent Holmes an \"emotional letter\" looking to, at the very least, be friends again, Australia's News Network reports. \"It's like he's finally recognized that Katie will always be the love of his life,\" the source says. Even so, \"It won't have been an over the top letter—it has been a year and I'm sure Tom will have been aware that Katie wouldn't be interested in running straight back into his arms.\" Sources close to Holmes say she was \"touched\" by the letter, which doesn't sound promising for Cruise. \"Tom would no doubt take her back in a second, but I don't think that's what Katie wants,\" says one.

The final round of elections, which covers Cairo and Alexandria, is scheduled for January 29 and 30.\n\nMeanwhile, in the ongoing trial of Mubarak and his inner circle, the former president and his sons Alaa and Gamal were present in the courtroom as proceedings resumed. Prosecutors presented evidence of corruption and abuse of power, while defense lawyers argued that there was no concrete evidence of wrongdoing. The trial is expected to continue for several more sessions.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections, the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafist Al-Nour Party were expected to make significant gains, with the Brotherhood potentially winning a majority of seats.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.
