{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as demonstrators refused to leave their encampments at City Hall despite eviction deadlines. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained at Dilworth Plaza, waiting for Mayor Michael Nutter to enforce the eviction order. Despite the deadline passing, no action was taken against the protesters, and city officials remained vague about their plans. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to disperse before dawn on Monday. However, police stopped short of clearing the encampment, and no arrests were made. Instead, attorneys for Occupy LA filed a request for a temporary restraining order to prevent the eviction.\n\nThe Occupy movements in both cities have been ongoing for several weeks, with protesters rallying against economic inequality and corporate greed. In Los Angeles, the encampment at City Hall had grown to over 1,000 people, making it one of the largest Occupy sites in the country. The Los Angeles encampment had been tolerated by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa for several weeks, but tensions escalated when negotiations between the city and protesters broke down.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the encampment had been smaller, with around 50 tents and several hundred protesters. Despite the smaller size, the protest had drawn attention from national figures, including hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, who tweeted his support for the protesters.\n\nBoth protests remained peaceful, with no reports of major violence or property damage. Protesters in both cities continued to chant slogans and serve food to each other, while police monitored the situation. The future of the encampments remains uncertain, with both mayors expressing a desire to find a peaceful resolution to the standoff.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and spiritual pain in a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church before his death in December 2013, at the age of 94. In the letter, published by Izvestia, a pro-Kremlin newspaper, Kalashnikov questioned his role in the many lives lost due to his invention. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for those deaths?\"\n\nKalashnikov, who was baptized at the age of 91, had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his weapon. The AK-47, which was designed to defend the Soviet Union during World War II, has been manufactured and used extensively around the world, including by child soldiers and terrorists.\n\nAlexa Internet, a web traffic analysis company, has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996. The data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.\n\nThe AK-47, which is known for its simplicity and reliability, has been produced in large quantities and is estimated to have been sold to over 100 countries. Its design was inspired by Kalashnikov's own experiences in the Red Army during World War II, when he noticed the dire need for a more effective weapon.\n\nDespite the weapon's widespread use and the controversy surrounding it, Kalashnikov received numerous awards and honors from the Soviet and Russian governments. He died in December 2013 and was attended by President Vladimir Putin at his funeral.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, which has been seeking to consolidate its power and influence in post-Soviet Russia, received a letter from Kalashnikov expressing his remorse and seeking spiritual guidance. The Church's position is that weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, and it supports their creators.\n\nKalashnikov's letter raises questions about the moral implications of inventing and using weapons, and the role of the state and religious institutions in shaping public discourse and values. It also highlights the complex relationship between technology, power, and morality in modern society.", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
{"pred": "\n\nOn November 1, 2013, at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a gunman identified as Paul Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with an assault rifle and opened fire, killing Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounding three others, including two TSA officers. The shooting caused chaos and panic at the airport, with travelers diving for cover and police responding quickly to contain the situation. Ciancia was eventually shot four times by airport police and taken into custody. He was later charged with murder and attempted murder, and the charges carry a potential death sentence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, it was reported that Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes before being transported to a hospital, where he later died. Paramedics were reportedly held back due to concerns about an active shooter and potential bombs in the terminal. The lack of immediate medical attention for Hernandez has raised questions about coordination between law enforcement and emergency responders.\n\nThe shooting also led to a public memorial service for Hernandez, who was the first TSA officer to be killed in the line of duty. Ciancia's condition was later upgraded from critical to fair at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. The incident has highlighted the need for improved communication and coordination between law enforcement and emergency responders in active shooter situations.", "answers": ["Unnamed officials say TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez lay bleeding for 33 minutes at LAX before being taken to an ambulance. For 28 of those minutes, alleged shooter Paul Ciancia was in police custody, though officers hadn't yet declared the area safe to enter. Officers checked on Hernandez, who was just 20 feet from an exit, then moved on while paramedics waited 150 yards away, the AP reports, noting it's not clear if immediate attention might have saved Hernandez's life. Now under review: the conversations took place between police and fire commanders to determine when it was safe enough to enter, and whether paramedics could have gone into the terminal earlier. While an officer who checked on Hernandez about 5 minutes after he was shot told numerous officers he was dead, the AP reports that it's not known whether that officer had the training needed to make that determination; no first-aid was administered. \"I basically think there's a lack of coordination between entities at this airport. That lack of coordination may have led to something that shouldn't have happened,\" an LAX employee says. \"We may be talking about Officer Hernandez as a survivor.\" The results of the investigation could be months away, the AP adds.
