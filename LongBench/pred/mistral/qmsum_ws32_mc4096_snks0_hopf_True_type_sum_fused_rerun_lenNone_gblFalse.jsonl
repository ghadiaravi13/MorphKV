{"pred": "During the discussion, it was suggested that users might prefer to say specific channel numbers instead of using buttons for channel selection. However, it was pointed out that users might have different channel preferences and following the same channel numbers might not be practical. The idea of personalized remote controls with individual channel settings was proposed. The group also considered the possibility of implementing gesture recognition for channel selection, but it was deemed expensive. Ultimately, it was decided to focus on the individual components of the remote control in the next meeting, with the UX designer focusing on the user interface concept, the industrial designer on the component concept, and the market expert on trend watching. The group also briefly discussed the possibility of adding speakers to the remote control, allowing it to answer with a beep or a voice message when clapped or whistled. However, they acknowledged that this feature might interfere with other devices and decided to explore it further in the next meeting.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels. However, in the Marketing's previous presentation, some people did love zapping, so the user interface designer suggested carrying out some research to find out how many people really needed to skip from one channel to another."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7338}

They also talked about keeping the number of buttons minimal and making it compatible with various devices such as a DVD player and a DVR. The team agreed on using a long box shape with a hard plastic case and a front that can be customized with different colors or designs. They also discussed the possibility of using a touch screen or voice commands for some functions. The next steps include individual research on materials and markets, and a follow-up meeting in thirty minutes to discuss the findings.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project.

She attributed this to a combination of factors, including the financial incentives not being enough to attract people, and the international issue of teacher recruitment and retention. She mentioned that they have set up an advisory board to look into the issue and have increased financial incentives, as well as launching a national recruitment campaign.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.
