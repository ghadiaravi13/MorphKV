In the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, immune cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. The smoke-exposed MRSA was also more resistant to reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, two lines of immune defense used to kill bacteria. Furthermore, MRSA was able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, increasing its chances of invasion. The second study, also published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances its survival against reactive oxygen species and makes it four times more resistant to macrophage killing. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, meaning a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendants in 12 hours. The studies were conducted to examine an alternative theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker, but instead, smoke makes the pathogen tougher. The studies focused on MRSA and its more sensitive relative MSSA as a good test case for this alternative theory. The findings suggest that cigarette smoke both harms smokers and assists pathogens, making MRSA infections even more difficult to treat.

Their findings suggest that the bloodstains on the shroud are inconsistent with each other and cannot be explained by a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers found that the hand stains on the shroud do not match the angle of gravity for a person hanging on a cross. The spear wound stain also did not match the pattern seen in their experiments. The lower back stain, which is a significant feature of the shroud, could not be replicated at all.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns suggest that the shroud is a fake or a medieval representation, rather than an authentic burial cloth. Borrini stated that the findings are consistent with police investigations and that the inconsistencies in the bloodstains are significant.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has been held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, for centuries and has been the subject of much debate and analysis.

The house, which was not a permanent residence, was likely used for feasts and gatherings. The site, which includes a massive enclosure of 15 hectares, is believed to have been built for status and wealth display.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child was discovered. The child, wearing an amber necklace, was found in a foetal position. Scientific analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, diet, and date of burial, which may shed light on where the child lived.\n\nBoth sites are part of the Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The show, known for its indulgent and sometimes confounding recipes, attracted both praise and criticism for its unconventional approach to cooking and television.\n\nDickson Wright's fiery personality and strong opinions made her a commanding presence on television.

The Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday, leaving little time to reach an agreement before the deadline.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against House Republicans, urging them to cave in to Democratic demands and fund the government without conditions. Reid believes that Republicans will suffer politically if a shutdown occurs, as vulnerable senators in red states could be negatively impacted.\n\nIf a shutdown does occur, it could have significant economic consequences, particularly for the Washington D.C. region, which is home to a large concentration of federal workers and contractors. An estimated $200 million in economic activity could be lost each day, and over 700,000 jobs could be affected. Federal services could be disrupted, including mail delivery, Amtrak trains, and national parks.\n\nDespite the looming deadline, there is still a chance that a compromise could be reached. Both parties have expressed a desire to avoid a shutdown, and there have been indications that Republicans may be open to a short-term funding bill to buy more time for negotiations. However, it remains to be seen whether such a bill would be acceptable to Democrats.\n\nIn the meantime, the political brinkmanship continues, with both parties accusing the other of being responsible for the potential shutdown.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

Parker, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, is credited with predicting the existence of solar wind in 1958. The mission, costing approximately $1.5 billion, is set to launch next summer and will provide vital insights into solar weather and its impact on Earth. The probe will travel up to 430,000 miles per hour and will withstand temperatures up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The incident sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning why the lion was not tranquilized instead. In South Africa, Sylvester, a 3-year-old male lion, also escaped from Karoo National Park and was being hunted due to concerns for public safety. However, an outcry from animal rights activists and the public led to a reconsideration of the decision to kill him, and officials are now considering various options, including relocating him to another park or donating him to a conservation group.\n\nThe incidents highlight the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. Last year, the killing of Cecil the lion in Zimbabwe by an American hunter caused international outrage and intensified concerns about the threatened species.\n\nThe circumstances of the stray lions also raised questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms.

All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, 'Hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one.'\" (Read about what JJ Watt's crowdsourced fundraiser accomplished in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1046}

However, two board members, venture capitalist Steve Jurvetson and Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, did not sign onto the statement.\n\nThe board statement left open the question of whether Musk had secured the necessary funding for the buyout.

The first article discusses a new paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, which revives the Kardashev scale, a theory proposed by Nikolai Kardashev in 1962 that categorizes civilizations based on their energy consumption. According to Hooper, advanced civilizations may need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving them isolated. This is due to the presence of dark energy, which is causing the universe to expand at an accelerating rate. The second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that advanced civilizations could use to harness the energy of their star. This idea was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in 1960 and later popularized by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his novel \"Star Maker.\" Dyson spheres consist of a swarm of satellites that surround a star and collect its energy. These structures have been a popular topic in science fiction, with examples including Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are currently at a relatively low level of energy consumption on the Kardashev scale, some scientists believe that advanced civilizations could already be harvesting energy from stars in other galaxies.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The Daily Show's format loosely followed a conventional newscast, with segments that satirized the news and pop culture. The creative process centered around co-creators Lizz Winstead and Madeleine Smithberg, with Stewart largely reading from the script during his first few years as host.\n\nIn 1998, Kilborn left The Daily Show to host The Late Show on CBS, and Stewart's tenure began in earnest. The show's tone shifted towards more political satire, with correspondents like Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell contributing to the program's success. Carell's most notable moment came in 1999 when he climbed aboard a bus carrying then-presidential candidate John McCain, leading to a memorable exchange about campaign finance.\n\nThe Daily Show's success continued into the 2000 presidential campaign, with the show's coverage of the election becoming a must-watch for many viewers. The show's deconstruction of the news and political process resonated with a younger demographic, helping to solidify its place in the media landscape.\n\nThroughout its history, The Daily Show has faced challenges and changes, both on and off-screen.

These discoveries include the oldest known Middle Stone Age tools, which are smaller and more specialized than earlier tools, and the earliest evidence of long-distance trading networks.\n\nThe team also found that the climate in East Africa during this time was undergoing dramatic shifts, which may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens. The new findings suggest that human populations in Africa were adapting to the environment and innovating technologically and culturally to survive.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the gap between the emergence of anatomically modern humans and behaviorally modern humans is no longer as clear-cut as previously believed. The evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya indicates that some hominin groups were exhibiting modern behaviors before the emergence of Homo sapiens.\n\nThe studies challenge the Eurocentric view that modernity arose only when humans migrated out of Africa and provide new insights into the complexity and depth of the African archaeological record.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

The Chinese ship Haixun 01 had previously detected signals on Friday and Saturday, but it was not yet clear if they were related to Flight 370. The signals were described as \"an important and encouraging lead,\" but caution was urged as they had not yet been verified. The search teams are under pressure to find the plane before the batteries in the black box run out, which is predicted to occur around March 24. The search has been ongoing for nearly a month, and no confirmed debris from the plane has been found. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is coordinating the search efforts. The search area is being expanded, and the Australian, Chinese, and Malaysian governments are working together to coordinate the search. The search is being complicated by the vast size of the search area and the challenging weather conditions. The batteries in the black box are expected to last for about a month, and the search teams are racing against time to locate the plane before they expire. The search is being led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is heading up the investigation into the disappearance of the plane. The search teams are using a range of technologies, including sonar, underwater cameras, and underwater drones, to search the ocean floor.

His parents, David and Louise, supported his decision and were thrilled with the outcome of the surgery.\n\nThe procedure, led by consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting cartilage from both sides of Kieran's chest and shaping it into frameworks for his ears.

In the case of Guantánamo, the Military Commissions Act of 2006 revoked the right to habeas corpus for anyone detained there, including legal residents of the U.S. The detainees, most of whom have little or no evidence against them, have been seeking to challenge their detention through habeas corpus petitions since 2002. However, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts.

This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by this legal procedure. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, hopes that this ruling could lead to the release of the chimpanzees and potentially other research animals. However, some legal experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, as the judge may simply want more information before making a decision on the legal personhood claim. The case began in December 2013, when the group petitioned three lower court judges with a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of four New York chimpanzees, arguing that they were too cognitively and emotionally complex to be held in captivity. The judges quickly struck down each case, but the Nonhuman Rights Project has been appealing ever since. Today's decision is the group's first major victory.

This discovery, made through the analysis of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars. The evidence includes maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium isotope, which indicate that early Mars had a global water layer at least 137 meters deep. This ancient ocean likely lasted for millions of years before gradually receding and eventually freezing, leaving behind only 13% of the original amount in the polar caps.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

New research suggests that dinosaurs may have vocalized with closed mouths, similar to modern birds. This theory is based on the analysis of living bird species and their vocal behaviors.

The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been present in some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes.\n\nThe study also sheds light on the evolution of bird vocalizations. Birds are the only living descendants of dinosaurs, and understanding their vocal behaviors can provide insights into the vocalizations of their extinct ancestors. The researchers plan to continue their investigation by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling.\n\nMeanwhile, in the world of pop culture, the iconic roars of dinosaurs in movies like Jurassic Park have long captivated audiences. However, these sounds were purely fictional, created in a studio rather than based on any scientific evidence.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The USA leads the world in obesity, with 87 million of the world's obese population, but other countries, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands, also have high obesity rates. The causes of obesity are complex and include the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications of weight kill around 3.4 million adults annually. The number of overweight and obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 33 years. The problem is not limited to rich countries; it now affects people of all ages, incomes, and regions, with not one country succeeding in cutting its obesity rate. The biggest increases in obesity among women were in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Honduras, and Bahrain, while among men, it was in New Zealand, Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, where more than 58% of adult men and 65% of adult women are overweight or obese. Obesity is appearing at increasingly young ages, with rates rising nearly 50% in children and adolescents worldwide. The rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in rich countries, but the problem is accelerating in developing countries.

The election took place amid growing opposition to the ruling military council, which has yet to clarify the powers of the new assembly and the formation of a new government.\n\nMubarak's trial resumed last week after a two-month hiatus, with the chief prosecutor accusing him of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and devoting the last 10 years of his three-decade presidency to ensuring his son, Gamal, would succeed him. Mubarak, who is currently in custody, faces charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of over 800 protesters during the 2011 uprising. His sons, Gamal and Alaa, are also on trial for corruption charges.\n\nThe prosecutor's comments in the courtroom were scathing, branding Mubarak a corrupt leader whose regime peaked in fraudulent parliamentary elections in 2010. Mubarak could face the death penalty if convicted. The military council, which took power after Mubarak's ouster in February 2011, has been criticized for its handling of the transition to democracy and its refusal to cede power to the elected assembly.\n\nClashes between security forces and protesters calling for an end to military rule left at least 17 people dead in December 2011.
