Their findings, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, suggest that the shroud may be a fake.\n\nThe researchers used a mannequin and synthetic blood to replicate the bloodstains on the shroud and found that the patterns were inconsistent with those that would be produced by a crucified person. They also discovered that some of the stains were impossible to explain based on the position of the mannequin or the flow of blood. The researchers concluded that the shroud's bloodstains were not authentic and that the cloth may have been manipulated or forged.\n\nThe Shroud of Turin has long been a source of controversy, with some believing it to be a genuine relic and others viewing it as a fake.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The house, which will be open to visitors next weekend, is as neatly levelled and regular as nearby modern houses, and is surrounded by a vast enclosure of 15 hectares, making it one of the biggest prehistoric monuments in the country.

The discovery was made from a well-preserved fossil that included both bones and feathers.\n\nThe dinosaur's feathers were not just for show, as some scientists believe.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

These findings challenge the previous theory that modern behaviors only emerged when humans migrated out of Africa.\n\nOne of the studies, led by paleoanthropologist Rick Potts, reports that Homo heidelbergensis, an early human ancestor, was making stone tools using a new technique called Levallois flint knapping. This technique required advanced planning and the ability to visualize the final product before creating it.\n\nAnother study, led by paleoanthropologist Meave Leakey, reports that Homo erectus, another early human ancestor, was making stone tools in a more standardized way, suggesting a more complex social organization.\n\nThe third study, led by archaeologist John Shea, suggests that the use of pigments for body painting and other decorative purposes may have emerged as early as 300,000 years ago.\n\nThese findings challenge the Eurocentric view that modern behaviors emerged only in Europe and that Africa was a \"backwater\" of human evolution. The researchers argue that Africa was actually a center of innovation and that humans were able to adapt to changing environments through technological and cultural advances.\n\nThe studies also shed new light on the role of climate change in shaping human behavior.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR.

Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Despite the initial challenges, Hooper never gave up on Cruz. She continued to teach him, even when other teachers had given up. Cruz's home life was difficult, with physical and emotional abuse from his stepfather. Hooper recognized the signs of abuse and reported it to the authorities. Eventually, Cruz was removed from his home and placed in foster care.\n\nDuring this time, Hooper's relationship with Cruz began to change. She saw the pain and trauma he had experienced and felt compassion for him. She continued to support him, even after he aged out of the foster care system and was on his own. Cruz, who had grown up without a stable family, found a sense of belonging with Hooper. They kept in touch, and eventually, Cruz asked Hooper if he could call her \"Mom.\" Hooper agreed, and they began the process of legal adoption.\n\nCruz's adoption was finalized in 1993, and he took Hooper's last name.

His parents, David and Louise Sorkin, supported his decision and were thrilled with the outcome. The surgery involved harvesting cartilage from both sides of Kieran's ribcage and shaping it into ear frameworks, which were then grafted onto his head. The ears were designed to match his mother's ears as closely as possible.\n\nThe procedure, which lasted six hours, was a success, and Kieran was described as being \"on cloud nine\" after the surgery.

According to a team of scientists from NASA, an ancient ocean covered nearly half of Mars' surface, making it a promising place for life to thrive. This discovery was made through the analysis of atmospheric water isotopes, which revealed strong isotopic anomalies and high enrichment in heavy water, indicating the loss of a large amount of water from Mars.\n\nThe researchers used data from three of the most powerful infrared telescopes in the world to create maps of the Martian atmosphere, revealing the presence of water ice in the polar regions and strong evidence of past water activity. The atmospheric data also showed that the released water had a representative deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, which is seven times higher than that of present-day Mars, suggesting that early Mars had a global layer of water that was at least 13 meters deep.\n\nFurthermore, the team found that the northern hemisphere of Mars had a higher concentration of water ice than the southern hemisphere, indicating that the northern hemisphere may have been the location of the ancient ocean. The scientists also noted that the northern hemisphere has a lower albedo, which could have contributed to the retention of more heat and the presence of a larger ocean in that region.\n\nThese findings challenge the previous belief that Mars was a dry and arid planet, and instead suggest that it was once a warm and wet world with the potential to support life. The discovery of an ancient ocean on Mars adds to the growing body of evidence that the planet was once habitable and could have supported microbial life.\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their investigation into the history of water on Mars and the conditions that may have contributed to its loss.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent discoveries, scientists have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs' roars, suggesting that they may have produced quieter, closed-mouth vocalizations instead. A study published in the journal Evolution found that some birds, which are descendants of dinosaurs, emit closed-mouth sounds during mating displays and territorial defense. These sounds are produced by inflating the syrinx, a vocal organ located at the base of the trachea, and are often used in combination with open-mouthed calls.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the vocalizations of various bird species and found that closed-mouth sounds are more common in large, territorial birds, which are similar in size and behavior to many dinosaurs. They also discovered that the anatomy of the syrinx in birds is similar to that of non-avian theropod dinosaurs, suggesting that dinosaurs may have been capable of producing closed-mouth vocalizations as well.\n\nFurther evidence for this theory comes from a study published in the journal PLOS ONE, which analyzed the fossilized footprints of a group of dinosaurs known as theropods. The researchers found that some of these footprints showed signs of feather impressions, suggesting that these dinosaurs were covered in feathers. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that theropods were scaly, and adds to the growing body of evidence that dinosaurs were more bird-like than previously thought.\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Science, used computer simulations to reconstruct the vocalizations of extinct dinosaurs based on the anatomy of their skulls and the vocalizations of modern birds. The researchers found that some dinosaurs may have produced low-frequency, closed-mouth vocalizations, while others may have emitted high-pitched, open-mouthed calls.\n\nThese findings have important implications for our understanding of dinosaurs and their behavior. They challenge the popular image of dinosaurs as roaring beasts and suggest that they may have been more complex and nuanced creatures, capable of a range of vocalizations. This new perspective on dinosaur vocalizations may also shed light on the evolution of vocal communication in animals, including humans.\n\nIn other news, researchers have discovered that the T. rex, one of the most iconic dinosaurs, may have had feathers", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that at least 23 people had been killed in Salamiyah, a town near Hama, since Thursday.
