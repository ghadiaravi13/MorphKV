{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as mayors in both cities faced pressure to evict the encampments. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained at City Hall, defying a deadline set by Mayor Nutter for them to leave. Despite the deadline passing, there were no immediate plans to evict the protesters, and police looked on as they continued their demonstration. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to disperse or face arrest. The deadline for them to leave City Hall had also passed, but no major actions were taken against the protesters, who had swelled to over 2,000 people.\n\nIn both cities, the protests remained peaceful, with no reports of major violence or property damage. In Los Angeles, four people were arrested before the deadline, but no further arrests were made overnight. In Philadelphia, police sources suggested that no eviction would take place before Tuesday.\n\nThe Occupy movements in both cities have been ongoing for several weeks, with protesters rallying against economic inequality and corporate greed. In Los Angeles, the encampment had grown to over 400 tents, making it one of the largest Occupy sites in the country. In Philadelphia, the encampment had been smaller, but had drawn support from local labor unions and other community groups.\n\nDespite the peaceful nature of the protests, mayors in both cities have faced criticism for their handling of the situation. In Los Angeles, some have accused Mayor Villaraigosa of heavy-handed tactics and a lack of transparency in his dealings with the protesters. In Philadelphia, some have criticized Mayor Nutter for his refusal to engage in dialogue with the protesters and his insistence on enforcing the eviction deadline.\n\nThe Occupy movements have gained widespread attention and support, with celebrities and politicians alike expressing their solidarity with the protesters. Hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons tweeted his support for the Occupy LA protesters, urging them to remain peaceful and nonviolent. Mayor Nutter received a similar message from hip-hop mogul Jay-Z, who urged the mayor to find a peaceful solution to the situation.\n\nAs the situation in", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the world-renowned AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and spiritual pain in a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church before his death in December 2013, at the age of 94. In the letter, published by the pro-Kremlin daily Izvestia, Kalashnikov questioned his role in taking lives and asked for forgiveness. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can I be considered a human?\"\n\nKalashnikov, who was born in 1919, designed the AK-47 after experiencing the hardships of World War II and the lack of effective weapons for the Soviet army. The rifle, which is now estimated to have been produced in over 100 million units, brought Kalashnikov fame and numerous awards. However, he reportedly refused to accept responsibility for the many lives lost due to his invention.\n\nIn his later years, Kalashnikov's pride in his creation was tempered with sadness. He attended a church service for the first time at the age of 91 and was later baptized. It is unclear how much of the letter was written by Kalashnikov himself, as his daughter, Elena, has stated that a priest may have helped him compose it.\n\nThe AK-47, which was first issued to the Soviet military in 1949, has become a symbol of power and resistance around the world. Its widespread use has led to its production and distribution in various countries, both legally and illegally. The rifle's simplicity and durability have made it a favorite among military forces and insurgent groups.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, which has consolidated its power and influence under President Vladimir Putin, has sought to strengthen its ties with the state and society. Kalashnikov's letter provides an interesting insight into the thoughts and feelings of a man who played a significant role in shaping the modern world through his invention.\n\nIn conclusion, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and sought forgiveness in a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church before his death.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
