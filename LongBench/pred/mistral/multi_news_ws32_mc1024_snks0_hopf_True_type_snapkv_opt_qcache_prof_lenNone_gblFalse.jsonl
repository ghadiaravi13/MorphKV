Mayor Nutter had given the group until 5 p.m. on Sunday to vacate the premises, but no action was taken by late evening. Police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan stated that the city was not planning to forcibly remove the protesters, and that they were allowed to stay as long as they followed the law. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to disperse or face arrest at around 1 a.m. on Monday. The crowd, estimated to be around 2,000 strong, had gathered to support the encampment, which had been given a midnight eviction deadline by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) had closed off the streets surrounding City Hall and were using riot gear. However, no arrests were made as of early Monday morning.\n\nThe Occupy movements in both cities have been ongoing for several weeks, with protesters rallying against economic inequality and corporate power. In Los Angeles, the encampment had grown to around 1,000 people, making it one of the largest Occupy sites in the country. In Philadelphia, the group had been camped out at City Hall since October 6. Both mayors had cited health and safety concerns as reasons for the evictions, but critics argue that the real motivation is to suppress the message of the Occupy movement.\n\nThe Occupy protests have gained widespread attention and support, with celebrities such as hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons using social media to urge mayors to show restraint. The movement has also sparked solidarity protests in other cities, including New York, Oakland, and Seattle. The future of the Occupy encampments in Philadelphia and Los Angeles remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the protests are not going away anytime soon.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park.

{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and guilt before his death in 2013, writing a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill. In the letter, Kalashnikov, who had previously refused to accept responsibility for the lives lost due to his weapon, expressed \"spiritual pain\" and asked if he, as a Christian and an Orthodox believer, could be held accountable for the deaths caused by his invention. The letter, published in Izvestia, raises questions about the authenticity of its content, as Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, believes a priest may have helped her father compose it.\n\nThe AK-47, which first entered service in 1949, has been a staple of military arsenals around the world due to its simplicity, reliability, and comparative ease of manufacture. More than 100 million units have been produced, making it one of the most widely used weapons in history. However, its widespread availability has also led to its use in conflicts and criminal activities, causing significant harm and suffering.\n\nKalashnikov, who was born in 1919, was inspired to design the rifle after experiencing the Red Army's lack of effective weapons during World War II. He was later awarded numerous accolades for his invention, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labor. Despite his pride in his creation, Kalashnikov reportedly felt sadness and regret over its use in conflicts and criminal activities.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church, which has consolidated its power and influence since the fall of the Soviet Union, has been supportive of Kalashnikov's late-in-life conversion to Christianity. The Church's press secretary, Cyril Volkov, stated that the Church supports weapons that defend the country and its people, and that Kalashnikov's letter reflects his spiritual growth and remorse.\n\nIn conclusion, Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and guilt before his death, writing a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
