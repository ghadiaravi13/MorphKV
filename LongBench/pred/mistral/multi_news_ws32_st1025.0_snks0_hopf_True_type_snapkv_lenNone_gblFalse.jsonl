The researchers also noted that some stains are inconsistent with the position of the body on the Shroud.\n\nDespite these findings, the researchers acknowledge that their investigation does not definitively prove that the Shroud is a fake.

The house, which is believed to be one of the best preserved from the period ever found in the UK, was discovered on the edge of the giant ditch and bank enclosure. Dr Jim Leary, director of the excavation, stated that the house could be more significant than Stonehenge, as it was the center of daily life during the Neolithic era. The house will be open to visitors next weekend as part of the national festival of archaeology.\n\nAt Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton of a child was discovered. The child was wearing an amber necklace and was found in a foetal position. Scientific analysis will be conducted to determine the gender, diet, and date of burial of the child. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, aims to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nBoth sites have produced numerous finds, including beautifully worked flint tools, Roman brooches, and pottery. Marden Henge, which is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country, has already revealed a Roman complex including a barn. The purpose of these monuments is believed to be status, showing off wealth and power in the ability to mobilize a massive workforce.\n\nThe excavations have shed new light on the archaeology of the fertile valleys, which have been overlooked due to the preservation of monuments on chalk.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge.

Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

The dinosaur was approximately the size of a crow and weighed around 1.5 kilograms. It had a crested head and a body covered in feathers, with some feathers showing signs of being used for flight. The discovery suggests that dinosaurs had more colorful and complex appearances than previously thought.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

The deadline for passing a new spending bill is fast approaching, and both parties are digging in their heels.\n\nHouse Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for conditions to be attached to the spending bill, including a delay of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, are refusing to consider such conditions and are urging the House to pass a clean bill to fund the government.\n\nThe economic impact of a shutdown would be significant, particularly in the Washington D.C. region, which is home to a large concentration of federal workers and contractors. An estimated $200 million in economic activity could be lost each day of a shutdown, and up to 700,000 jobs could be affected.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has urged Congress to pass a clean bill to avoid a shutdown, but it is unclear whether the House will relent. The Senate is expected to reconvene on Monday to consider the bill, but it is unlikely that a resolution will be reached before the deadline.\n\nSenior Democrats, including Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, have accused House Republicans of playing politics with the shutdown and putting the economy at risk. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that they are standing up for the American people and fighting against Obamacare.\n\nThe standoff comes as the government is also facing the possibility of a debt ceiling crisis in the coming weeks. Some analysts have warned that a government shutdown could make it more difficult to reach a deal on the debt ceiling, potentially leading to a default on U.S. debt.\n\nThe situation is fluid, and developments are expected to unfold rapidly in the coming days. The White House and Congress are urging the public to stay informed and to contact their representatives to express their views on the issue.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025.

Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The researchers believe that this planet is about 10 times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun every 10,000 to 20,000 years.\n\nBrown has no regrets about Pluto's demotion and is excited about the potential discovery of a new planet. He and his team are continuing their search for Planet Nine and hope to have more concrete evidence in the coming years. The discovery of this new planet would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system and could provide new insights into its formation and evolution.\n\nIn other news, Pluto continues to be a topic of debate among scientists and the public. Some argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, while others believe that the definition of a planet should be stricter. Regardless, the search for Planet Nine is a reminder of the ongoing exploration and discovery in astronomy.\n\nAdditionally, astronomers have discovered a black hole that is 66 billion times the mass of the sun, located in a galaxy far beyond our own. This discovery challenges our understanding of the universe and the limits of black hole size.\n\nLastly, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft, which flew by Pluto in 2015, is now on its way to study another object in the Kuiper Belt, named Arrokoth. This flyby is expected to provide new insights into the composition and structure of these distant objects.\n\nOverall, it's an exciting time in astronomy with new discoveries and debates shaping our understanding of the universe.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

According to a study led by Dr. Samantha Hendren at the University of Michigan, one in every seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This trend is raising questions about the current guidelines for screening, which recommend starting at age 50.\n\nThe study analyzed data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease, with 38% of those under 50 having regional or distant spread compared to 25% of those aged 50 and older. Despite this, younger patients had better survival rates, with 5-year survival rates of 65% compared to 58% for older patients.\n\nThe study also found that younger patients were more likely to receive aggressive treatments, such as surgery and chemotherapy, which may contribute to their better outcomes.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "\n\nIn two separate news articles, the possibility of advanced alien civilizations and their potential energy consumption has been explored. The first article discusses a new paper by astrophysicist Dan Hooper, which suggests that advanced civilizations may need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent being left alone in the expanding universe due to dark energy. This idea, originally proposed by Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, suggests that civilizations go through three stages of energy consumption: Type I, II, and III. Type I civilizations harness all the energy available on their planet, Type II civilizations harness all the energy from their star, and Type III civilizations harness all the energy in their galaxy. The second article discusses the concept of Dyson spheres, which are hypothetical megastructures that could be used by advanced civilizations to capture and harness the energy of their star. This concept was first introduced in science fiction by Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker,\" and later popularized by physicist Freeman Dyson. Dyson spheres could potentially be detected by astronomers through infrared radiation or other unusual signatures. The articles highlight the potential for advanced alien civilizations to leave detectable signs of their existence through their energy consumption and waste products.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The incident occurred in March 2014 when the panda, which was being chased by other villagers, entered Guan's land and bit him in the leg. The attack left Guan with severe injuries that required seven hours of surgery and may necessitate further operations. The panda escaped after the attack. Guan's son sued the local forestry officials and the Baishuijiang National Nature Reserve, which is home to over 100 wild pandas, for compensation. Following negotiations, officials agreed to pay the compensation.\n\nGiant pandas, renowned for their lovable appearance, are members of the bear family and have a fearsome bite. They are native to mountainous southwestern China and have a notoriously low reproductive rate, making them under pressure from habitat loss. Despite their placid image, pandas can protect themselves using their heavy weight, strong jaw muscles, and large molar teeth. They have been known to attack humans, and in 2008, a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who climbed into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. Pandas generate significant tourist revenue for China, and the number of wild pandas rose nearly 17 percent over the decade to 2013 to reach 1,864, according to a government survey.\n\nThe villager's attack highlights the potential danger posed by wild pandas, despite their popularity and the conservation efforts aimed at protecting them.

Egypt's Prime Minister Hisham Kandil visited Gaza on Friday in an attempt to broker a ceasefire, but the situation remains tense. The conflict has raised concerns of a wider regional conflict and has strained diplomatic relations between Israel and Egypt.

The conflict has also disrupted daily life in both Israel and Gaza, with schools and businesses closed and air raid sirens sounding regularly. The international community, including the United States, has called for a de-escalation of the situation and urged both sides to return to the negotiating table.

This discovery, made by analyzing atmospheric water isotopes, challenges the previous belief that water was a rare presence on Mars. The evidence includes maps of atmospheric water and its deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio, which indicate that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. This finding adds to the growing body of evidence that Mars was a warmer and wetter planet in its youth, with streams, lakes, and perhaps even oceans.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean raises the possibility that Mars could have supported life in its past. Michael Mumma, a senior scientist at the Southwest Research Institute, said, \"Ultimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering a significant fraction of the planet opens the idea of habitability and the evolution of life on the planet.\"\n\nThe researchers used data from three of the most powerful telescopes in the world to make their findings. They looked at the deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in the Martian atmosphere, which is a measure of the water loss history of the planet. The results showed that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, indicating the presence of a large body of water.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean challenges the previous belief that Mars was a dry and barren planet. It also adds to the growing body of evidence that Mars was once a habitable planet, which could have supported life. The search for life on Mars will continue, with the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover set to land on the planet in 2018.\n\nThe discovery of this ancient ocean also raises questions about the causes of Mars' current dry climate. Some scientists believe that the loss of the ancient ocean was due to the planet's weak magnetic field, which allowed solar wind to strip away the water.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

By piecing together brain patterns as subjects watched YouTube videos, scientists were able to reconstruct the videos based on neural activity. This is the first time that continuous, dynamic visual experiences have been reconstructed from brain activity. The researchers involved, Jack Gallant and Shinji Nishimoto, believe this technology could eventually lead to seeing into people's dreams, memories, and thoughts without the need for visual stimulation. Gallant stated, \"We are opening a window into the movies in our minds.\"\n\nThe experiment involved subjects spending hours inside an MRI machine while watching YouTube videos.

The researchers were able to decode the movies people saw and layer all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity pattern.\n\nThis technology could potentially be used to broadcast imagery, allowing people with paralyzing conditions to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements. However, ethical concerns arise regarding the potential use of this technology in court cases or detective work.

The ruling military council, which took power after Mubarak's ouster, has promised to hand over power to a civilian government by the end of June 2012.\n\nThe elections and the trial take place amid growing opposition to the military council's rule. Protests have been held regularly since Mubarak's ouster, with demonstrators demanding an end to military rule and the implementation of democratic reforms. The economic situation in Egypt is also deteriorating, with growth slowing down and foreign investment dwindling.\n\nThe new parliament is expected to face significant challenges, including the drafting of a new constitution, the formation of a new government, and the implementation of economic reforms. The political landscape in Egypt is still uncertain, with many questions remaining about the role of the military in politics and the future of the country's democratic transition.", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
