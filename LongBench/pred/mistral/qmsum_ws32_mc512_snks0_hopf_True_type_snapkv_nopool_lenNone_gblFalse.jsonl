She attributed this to a lack of interest in teaching as a profession, both in Wales and internationally. To address this issue, the Welsh Government has taken several steps, including improving ITE provision, offering financial incentives, and launching a national recruitment campaign. They are also looking at ways to make teaching a more attractive career, such as offering flexible working arrangements and addressing workload issues.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

Ultimately, they decided to explore both options and consider the costs and user preferences in their decision.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
