{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as demonstrators refused to leave city hall grounds despite eviction deadlines set by mayors in both cities. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained at Dilworth Plaza, with no sign of imminent eviction. Police looked on calmly as protesters chanted slogans and served soup to the crowd. Mayor Nutter had set a deadline for the group to leave, citing the need to prepare the area for winter renovations. However, he avoided specifying a timeline for the eviction, stating only that he expected the protesters to pack up and leave.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy LA protesters to disperse or face arrest. Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside City Hall, defying a midnight deadline to leave. Police had been present since early morning, but had not yet moved to evict the protesters. The Los Angeles encampment, which had been in place since October, was one of the largest on the West Coast and part of the 2-month-old Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nBoth protests were met with support from celebrities and activists, with hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons tweeting to Mayor Nutter urging restraint and avoiding violence. In Los Angeles, attorneys for the protesters were on hand to advise those facing arrest. The overall mood at both protests remained peaceful, with protesters expressing their frustration with corporate greed and economic inequality.\n\nDespite the ongoing protests, some protesters were packing up and leaving voluntarily, citing the cold weather and the uncertainty of their future plans. Others remained committed to staying put until their demands were met. The standoff between the protesters and city officials continued into the early hours of Monday, with no clear resolution in sight.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse before his death in 2013, writing a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, expressing his \"spiritual pain\" over the many lives lost due to his invention. The letter, published in Izvestia, reveals that Kalashnikov had been suffering from guilt for the weapon's deadly impact. He had previously refused to acknowledge any responsibility for the deaths caused by the AK-47.\n\nThe AK-47, designed by Kalashnikov in 1949, is one of the most widely used and recognizable weapons in the world, with over 100 million units sold. Its simplicity and reliability made it a popular choice for military forces and insurgents alike. However, its use in conflicts around the world has led to numerous deaths and human suffering.\n\nKalashnikov's letter to the Patriarch was typed on his personal writing paper and signed by him, describing his spiritual pain as \"unbearable.\" He questioned whether he was to blame for the deaths caused by his rifle and expressed regret for the role his invention played in people's lives.\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church received the letter and replied, acknowledging the weapon's impact on people's lives but also recognizing the role it played in defending the country. The Church's press secretary, Cyril Volkov, stated that the Church had received the letter and that Patriarch Kirill had responded.\n\nKalashnikov's conversion to Christianity and his remorse over the AK-47's impact came late in his life. He was baptized at the age of 91 and attended festivities celebrating his 90th birthday at the Kremlin. His change of heart was a surprise to many, given his past public statements and the widespread use of his weapon.\n\nThe AK-47's legacy continues to be felt around the world, with its use in conflicts and insurgencies leading to countless deaths and human suffering. Kalashnikov's late-in-life expression of remorse provides a complex and nuanced perspective on the man behind the weapon and the impact it has had on the world.", "answers": ["In our own obituary of AK-47 inventor Mikhail Kalashnikov last month, we included this quote: The rifle was invented \"for the protection of the Motherland,\" he said. \"I have no regrets and bear no responsibility for how politicians have used it.\" It turns out \"no regrets\" might not have exactly been true. The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
