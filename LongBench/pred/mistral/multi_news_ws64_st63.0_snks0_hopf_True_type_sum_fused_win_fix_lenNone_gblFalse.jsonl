MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections and is often resistant to antibiotics.\n\nIn the first study, published in the journal Infection and Immunity, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract had a significantly harder time being killed by macrophages, immune cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. The smoke extract made MRSA more resistant to reactive oxygen species, a chemical burst macrophages utilize once they have engulfed bacteria, and antimicrobial peptides, another line of immune defense. MRSA was also able to adhere better to human cells when treated with smoke, making it more successful in its invasion. The more smoke extract the MRSA was exposed to, the more resistant it became.\n\nThe second study, also published in the journal Infection and Immunity, found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances, enhancing its survival against reactive oxygen species. MRSA exposed to smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, meaning a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendants in 12 hours.\n\nThe studies were conducted to examine an alternative theory that cigarette smoke mostly causes disease by harming the smoker, but instead, smoke makes the pathogen tougher.

The investigation revealed inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, suggesting that the shroud may be a fake.\n\nThe shroud, which is held in the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in Turin, Italy, has long been a subject of debate and study. It is regarded by the Vatican as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and has been analyzed for decades. More than 2 million people came to see the shroud during a three-month display in 2015, including Pope Francis.\n\nThe researchers used real and synthetic blood samples on cloth to test the orientation of stains on the shroud. They hoped to answer the debate over the crucifixion depicted on the cloth, but instead found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose. This suggests that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns at different angles for the hands, chest, and back.\n\nIf the shroud were a genuine death shroud of a crucified person, the bloodstains should not be so inconsistent, according to Borrini. They conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric: the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back, along with a belt of blood at the waist. The researchers discovered that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part.\n\nThe findings of the investigation have raised questions about the authenticity of the shroud and added to evidence that it may be a medieval fraud.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The experience left Davis with an indescribable blackness, a deep, dark despair and grief that made her wonder if she would ever surface.\n\nIn the second instance, Davis experienced an ectopic pregnancy in 1994, which was technically considered an abortion and required doctors to report it as such. Such pregnancies are generally not viable, and terminating them is considered medically necessary to save the mother's life.

However, the tax has faced significant opposition, with critics arguing that it doesn't make people healthier, drives revenue outside city limits, and disproportionately affects low-income families. The tax has led to significant price increases for consumers, with a case of Gatorade increasing by over 60%. Retailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to locations outside the city where they can avoid the tax. The tax has also faced legal challenges, with retailers suing over its application to syrups and powders used in restaurants.

The tax has also faced controversy in other jurisdictions, with Cook County in Illinois repealing its similar tax within two months due to public outcry and significant revenue losses. The tax has been criticized for its inconsistency, with some beverages exempted and others subject to the tax. The tax has also faced criticism for its potential impact on small businesses and the hospitality industry, which already faces a cumulative burden of various taxes.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

{"pred": "\n\nTwo recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, a common pain reliever and fever reducer, during pregnancy. The first study, published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, found that pregnant women who frequently took acetaminophen were more likely to have children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar issues. The researchers cautioned that this doesn't mean that taking acetaminophen once will cause ADHD, but advised pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use. The second study, also published in JAMA Pediatrics, found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD-like behaviors or being prescribed ADHD medications. However, the studies did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nAcetaminophen is commonly recommended to pregnant women for treating mild pain, but the new studies have raised questions about its safety. The Danish study analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers and found that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with a severe form of ADHD called hyperkinetic disorder (HKD) or being prescribed ADHD medications. The study also suggested that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks.\n\nThe makers of Tylenol, the brand name for acetaminophen, released a statement saying that when used as directed, Tylenol has one of the most favorable safety profiles among over-the-counter pain relievers and that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nSome experts suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, other experts caution that the studies do not prove that acetaminophen causes ADHD and that there are many variables that still need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families.\n\nThe studies highlight the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted and of exploring nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and ac", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

The House of Representatives passed a bill to fund federal agencies through December 15, with conditions to delay the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) for one year and repeal the medical device tax. However, Senate Democrats and President Obama have vowed to reject any changes to the health law, and the Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, close to the midnight deadline for passing legislation to avoid a shutdown.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a hardline stance against House Republicans, urging President Obama to avoid a meeting with congressional leaders at the White House, as he believes it would only result in a photo opportunity with no substantive negotiations. Reid and the Democratic leadership are determined to keep Obamacare intact and have the support of the White House.\n\nIf the impasse continues, a partial government shutdown could occur, affecting an estimated 700,000 jobs in the Washington D.C. area alone, according to local economist Stephen Fuller. The region, which has the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, could lose $200 million a day during a shutdown. The impact would not only be felt economically but also in terms of federal services, with no new applications for benefits, no new housing or small-business loans, and a halt in clinical trials for research funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe region's economy has already been weakened by across-the-board sequestration cuts earlier this year, which cost the area 26,500 net jobs in August. With furloughs and agencies not filling positions, the federal payroll is down $2 billion from last year, and federal contracting is down $5 billion.\n\nThe potential shutdown comes at a time when the region's economy is already struggling, and the impact could be devastating for the Washington area. Lawmakers are attempting to pass legislation to exempt the District from a potential shutdown, as it did in 1995 when a political impasse between President Clinton and a Republican-controlled House led to a three-week shutdown.\n\nThe House and Senate could agree on a compromise before the deadline, but it is not clear how that", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, which is set to launch in summer 2018, will be the first to touch the sun and will provide valuable insights into the mysteries of solar wind and space weather. The spacecraft will carry advanced technology to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation, and will make 24 close passes through the sun's corona over the course of its seven-year mission. Parker, who is still alive and attended the announcement, was instrumental in predicting the existence of solar wind in the 1950s and is considered a pioneer in the field of solar astrophysics. The mission's objectives include tracing the energy that heats the corona, understanding the acceleration of the solar wind, and studying the solar wind in the close vicinity of the sun. The findings from this mission could revolutionize our understanding of stars and improve space weather forecasting. The Parker Solar Probe is expected to reach speeds of up to 430,000 miles per hour and will fly within 3.83 million miles of the sun's surface, making it the closest-ever approach to the sun by a human-made object.

Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind.

The incident sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning why tranquilizers were not used instead. The Kenya Wildlife Service stated that the lion had escaped from Nairobi National Park and became agitated by the large crowd that had gathered around it, leading to the fatal shooting. In South Africa, Sylvester, a 3-year-old male lion, also escaped from Karoo National Park and was being hunted due to the potential threat he posed to humans. The decision to kill him was met with opposition, with many advocating for his capture and relocation instead.\n\nThe incidents highlight the delicate balance between protecting people and conserving lions, whose numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to unregulated hunting, habitat loss, and conflict with livestock herders. The loss of human life poses a significant danger to lions, as they may lose their fear for humans and see them as easy prey.\n\nThe circumstances of the stray lions also fueled questions about whether to dart a potentially dangerous predator with a tranquilizer and return it to a fenced area, or kill it before it can attack people. Such decisions depend on factors including the training of wildlife experts, their resources, and the population density of the area where the lion is roaming. In some cases, local residents have taken matters into their own hands and killed lions before officials arrived on the scene.\n\nThe incidents also shed light on the challenges faced by national parks in Africa as they struggle to maintain the balance between conservation and development.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent discoveries, astronomers at Caltech believe they have found evidence for a new planet, which they are calling Planet Nine or Planet X, located at the far reaches of our solar system. The planet, estimated to be five times the mass of Earth and 10 times the size of Earth, is believed to have an elliptical orbit that takes it from 30 to 100 times the distance from the sun as Neptune. The existence of Planet Nine is inferred from the gravitational effects it has on other objects in the outer solar system, such as dwarf planets and other small bodies.\n\nMike Brown, one of the researchers involved in the discovery, is no stranger to controversy in the world of planetary science. He was instrumental in the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet larger than Pluto, which led to Pluto's demotion from planet status in 2006. Brown has embraced the nickname \"Pluto Killer\" and now hopes to add another planet to the solar system's roster.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on multiple continents scanning the night sky for any signs of the elusive planet. The discovery of Planet Nine would reconfigure our understanding of the solar system and potentially lead to a reevaluation of planetary status for other objects in the outer solar system.\n\nDespite the excitement surrounding the potential discovery of Planet Nine, some scientists remain skeptical and call for further evidence before making any definitive claims. NASA's Jim Green, the director of planetary science at NASA, expressed his excitement about the research but cautioned that \"it's going to depend on whether or not we can actually find it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pluto supporters continue to argue for its reinstatement as a planet, but the scientific community remains divided on the issue. Mike Brown, however, remains unapologetic about his role in Pluto's demotion and is focused on the search for Planet Nine. \"I'm sad about the way the last decade has gone since Pluto's demotion,\" he said, \"but I'm hoping that after New Horizons, those discussions will die down and we can begin talking about Pluto and what we have learned about the rest of the Kuiper Belt.\"\n", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

The study, which was sponsored by Pfizer and followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those with the highest weight variability had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.\n\nCoronary artery disease, also known as coronary heart disease, is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. It develops when the major blood vessels that supply the heart with blood, oxygen, and nutrients become damaged or diseased, often due to cholesterol-containing deposits and inflammation. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nPrevious studies have associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health.

The forecast, which is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, was considered by many to be the most dire and effective weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service.\n\nAt the time, evacuations were underway and people were starting to arrive at the Superdome. Ricks knew he had one last chance to get the message out. He sat down at his desk and using computers, history, and his fellow forecasters, he wrote the extraordinary bulletin titled \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" The document predicted devastating damage, including roof and wall failure for most homes, total defoliation of trees, and water shortages leading to incredible human suffering.\n\nRicks' forecast was right, and the images of devastation that followed made it clear. The lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, was back at work alongside co-workers who had no homes and were wearing the clothes they wore that day. Ricks, who had experienced Hurricanes Betsy and Camille in the past, was devastated by the response, but he had done everything in his power to warn people of the monster storm coming their way.", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans.

As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%).

{"pred": "\n\nIn two separate news articles, the possibility of advanced alien civilizations harvesting energy from stars to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving them isolated was discussed. The first article, published on Live Science, focused on a new paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago. Hooper's paper revived the idea of Kardashev's three types of technologically advanced civilizations and added a new, apocalyptic twist. According to Hooper, as the universe expands at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will fall beyond the cosmic horizon, making them unobservable and inaccessible. To prevent this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest the energy from these stars before they become inaccessible.\n\nThe second article, while not directly related to Hooper's paper, discussed the concept of Dyson spheres, which are colossal structures that could permanently hover around a star and beam its energy back to a nearby planet. This idea was first proposed by Freeman Dyson in a scientific paper in 1960 and later popularized in science fiction. Dyson spheres would be made up of millions of solar-powered satellites, also known as statites, which would hover in space and form a cloud around the star, collecting its energy and beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nBoth articles emphasized the importance of energy in advanced alien civilizations and the need to expand beyond their home planet and star to access more resources. The concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been a popular topic in science fiction, with examples including Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are currently at the lower end of Kardashev's scale, some scientists believe that there could be alien civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours that are already in their star-harvesting phase.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The findings challenge the belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art suddenly arose during a \"human revolution\" 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, researchers now suggest that these behaviors emerged in response to long-term, global environmental and climatic changes around 300,000 years ago.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya, which was once a series of floodplains, underwent significant climate changes that made food sources unpredictable. To adapt, early human populations needed to become more mobile, share information, and innovate.\n\nExcavations at five sites dating from 320,000 years ago revealed distinct differences in stone tool forms compared to older deposits. Older sites yielded large, bulky stone tools such as hand axes, while these sites contained much smaller, standardized pieces such as points and blades. Many of these tools were made from obsidian, which came from great distances, and some were modified for hafting. Obsidian and red ochre, used for coloring rocks, mark the earliest known evidence of long-distance transport of raw materials in the East African record.\n\nThe Middle Stone Age, characterized by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies, is well-established across Africa. The transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent. However, it is too soon to conclude that the appearance of the earliest Middle Stone Age technology is a cultural marker linked to the evolution and appearance of modern humans.\n\nThe discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin suggest that one or more hominin groups were doing seemingly \"modern\" things during this critical time period. These groups required an understanding of space and time, as they brought materials over great distances and passed on technological skills through generations. This evidence of expanded social networks, information transmission, and technological innovation challenges the traditional view of a sudden \"human revolution.\"", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

First, the airline has updated its boarding process to reduce congestion and speed up loading times. The new process involves fewer boarding lanes, with priority passengers and elite members using lane 1 and all other passengers using lane 2. Additionally, United is launching push notifications for those with the airline's mobile app, allowing them to be notified when boarding begins. This new boarding process follows several years of experimentation, as United previously used five lanes to feed through passengers, which created idle standing passengers and congestion near the gate, especially during delays. United's competitors, American and Delta, already use similar processes.\n\nSecond, United has announced a joint business agreement (JBA) with Copa and Avianca, pending government approval. The JBA is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities, and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. The carriers plan to offer many benefits, including integrated, seamless service in more than 12,000 city pairs, new nonstop routes, additional flights on existing routes, reduced travel times, and economic benefits for consumers. The JBA is expected to drive competition and growth in the U.S.-Latin American market, which currently lacks a comprehensive revenue-sharing network among carriers.\n\nOverall, United's changes aim to improve the passenger experience by reducing congestion and offering more choices and benefits for customers.

Divers are hopeful that they will find many of the passengers and crew still strapped in their seats inside the wreckage.\n\nThe plane, which was flying from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore, was denied permission to climb to a higher altitude due to heavy air traffic just before it disappeared from radar. The cause of the crash remains unclear, but bad weather is believed to have been a factor. Indonesia's Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency released a 14-page report suggesting that the plane may have flown into bad weather, which could have caused ice to form on the wings.\n\nAirAsia, which began operations in 2001 and quickly became one of the region's most popular low-cost carriers, has been grounded from flying from Surabaya to Singapore due to the lack of a permit for that route on Sundays. However, Singapore's Civil Aviation Authority has stated that the airline had been approved to fly the route daily. AirAsia is currently reviewing the suspension.\n\nThe search for debris and bodies has been hampered by strong currents and towering waves, which have scattered bodies and debris in all directions.

Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz has expressed frustration over the lack of transparency in the investigation, as the government has not disclosed exactly how the company allegedly violated the law.\n\nThe Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law amended in 2008 to include plants, requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has conducted independent investigations and concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar. Gibson denies these allegations and maintains that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe C.F. Martin Guitar Co. in Nazareth, Pa., previously considered Madagascar rosewood as a substitute for Brazilian rosewood, whose trade was banned in the 1990s due to over-harvest. However, when a coup occurred in Madagascar, the international community concluded that the resulting government was illegitimate, and the Martin company stopped importing wood from the country.\n\nThe Lacey Act is retroactive and has raised concerns among guitar builders, who fear they may be forced to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago. Attorney Ronald Bienstock has warned clients to be wary of traveling abroad with old guitars, as the law requires owners to account for every wooden part when re-entering the U.S.\n\nSince 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive, which adds the data to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

The ocean, which was a mile deep in places, held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, equivalent to more than the Arctic Ocean. This new finding challenges the previous belief that water was an erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only occasionally and never forming long-standing seas and oceans.\n\nThe evidence for the ancient ocean comes from atmospheric maps of water and its deuterated form (HDO) across the martian globe. These maps reveal strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment, indicating great water loss. The released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth’s ocean (VSMOW). The atmospheric maps also indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, suggesting that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe scientists used three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world, including the Keck II telescope, Nasa’s Infrared Telescope Facility, and the ESO’s Very Large Telescope, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons.\n\nThe higher concentration of deuterium in water left behind on Mars indicates that it must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, meaning that Mars must have lost more than six times that now locked up in the planet’s frozen ice caps.\n\nThe ocean likely lasted for millions of years but eventually receded and eventually froze due to the thinning atmosphere and the loss of insulation. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up in the Martian polar caps.\n\nThis new finding adds to the emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": "\n\nThe European Court of Justice has overturned a decision made by the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) in 2012, which granted Nestlé the trademark for the shape of its Kit Kat four-finger wafer bars. The ruling came after an appeal by Mondelez, which argued that the shape was not distinctive enough to be trademarked across all EU member states. The court found that Nestlé had failed to provide sufficient evidence that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has also been a topic of debate in the Brexit discussion, with some suggesting that EU courts have failed to protect British treats. The dispute between Nestlé and Mondelez is not the only one involving chocolate giants and trademarks. In the UK, Nestlé objected to Cadbury's trademark for the purple color used to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The case has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could take account of other evidence and preserve protection for KitKat's shape. Nestlé and Mondelez have both been global chocolate giants for decades, with Nestlé buying Rowntree's, the original Kit Kat maker, in 1988, and Mondelez acquiring Cadbury in 2010. The Kit Kat has been a popular snack since its introduction in 1935, while Kvikk Lunsj, a Norwegian four-finger wafer bar, has been around since 1937. The two treats lived together in harmony for decades until Nestlé went on the offensive in 2002, applying for a trademark for the shape of a Kit Kat in Europe.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": "\n\nIn a series of recent discoveries, scientists have challenged the common perception of dinosaurs as roaring beasts, suggesting instead that some may have cooed or mumbled with closed mouths. A study published in the journal Evolution argues that closed-mouth vocalizations, which generate resonance conditions favoring low-frequency sounds, have evolved independently at least 16 times within birds and their extinct reptilian ancestors, the archosaurs. This behavior, which is used primarily for territorial or courtship displays, is rare among small-bodied birds but common in larger species. The researchers, from the University of Texas, Midwestern University, Memorial University of Newfoundland, and the University of Utah, analyzed the vocalizations of various bird and crocodilian species and found that closed-mouth vocalizations are most common in large-bodied birds, such as doves and ostriches. The study's lead author, Tobias Riede, explained that the physical challenge of inflating a small cavity makes closed-mouth vocalizations less feasible for smaller animals. While no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like, the researchers suggest that some may have made closed-mouth vocalizations, given their large body sizes and the occurrence of this behavior in modern birds and crocodiles. The study is part of a new collaboration funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to understand the origin and evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the wide range of sounds it can produce. The researchers plan to integrate information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling to gain a better understanding of the sounds extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors may have made. Meanwhile, a separate study published in the journal Current Biology found that the mighty T. rex may have had feathers, challenging another long-held belief about the appearance of this iconic dinosaur. The researchers, from the University of Manchester and the University of Edinburgh, analyzed the fossilized remains of a T. rex and found evidence of quill-like structures, suggesting that the dinosaur had a covering of feathers or proto-feathers. The discovery adds to a growing body of evidence that many dinosaurs were covered in feathers or feather-like structures, rather than being scaly as previously believed.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

The causes of obesity are complex and include the availability of cheap, high-calorie junk food and sedentary lifestyles. Obesity is a major risk factor for various health issues such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, and chronic complications of weight kill around 3.4 million adults annually. The number of overweight and obese people has increased by 28% in adults and 47% in children over the past 33 years.
