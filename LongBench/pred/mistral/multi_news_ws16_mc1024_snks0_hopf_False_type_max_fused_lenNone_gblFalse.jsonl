{"pred": "\n\nProtesters from the Occupy movement in both Philadelphia and Los Angeles remained at their respective encampments outside city halls despite eviction deadlines set by their mayors. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters sat down at Dilworth Plaza on November 28, waiting for police to evict them. However, police had no plans to do so that evening, and the protesters were allowed to stay. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to disperse or face arrest. No arrests were made as of early Monday morning, and the encampment remained at City Hall. In both cities, the mayors had given deadlines for the protesters to leave, citing health and safety concerns and the need for renovations. However, many protesters refused to move, citing their right to peaceful assembly and their opposition to corporate greed and economic inequality. Supporters from organized labor, clergy, and other groups streamed into the areas to show solidarity with the protesters. The Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, was one of the largest on the West Coast. Attorneys for Occupy LA asked for an injunction to prevent police from evicting the camp, arguing that the mayor and police chief had violated their civil rights. The national Occupy Wall Street movement, which began in September, has been protesting economic inequality and excesses of the U.S. financial system.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morningâ€”though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
