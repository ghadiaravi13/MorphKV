{"pred": "\n\nProtests at Occupy Philadelphia and Occupy Los Angeles continued into the early hours of Monday, November 28, as demonstrators refused to leave their encampments at City Hall despite eviction deadlines set by city officials. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained at Dilworth Plaza, waiting for police to enforce the mayor's order for them to vacate the premises. Despite the deadline passing, no action was taken against the protesters, and police chief Joseph Sullivan stated that confrontation was not their intention. In Los Angeles, police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse from the area surrounding City Hall, but no arrests were made as of early Monday morning. The Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to over 400 tents, had been given a midnight deadline to leave, but the police ultimately allowed the protesters to stay until daylight. The national Occupy movement, which began in September as a protest against economic inequality, has seen similar confrontations in cities across the country, with mayors and police departments taking varying approaches to dealing with the encampments. In some cases, such as in New York City, authorities have used force to clear the camps, while in others, such as in Portland, Oregon, officials have allowed the protesters to remain indefinitely. The movement has gained widespread attention and support, with celebrities and politicians expressing their solidarity with the cause. The future of the Occupy encampments remains uncertain, as city officials continue to weigh the costs of allowing the protests to continue against the potential for civil unrest.", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park. Two hours after protesters defied city hall's order to vacate the park by 12:01am, lawyer and Occupy supporter Jim Lafferty told Reuters he expected police to give the camp a two-day reprieve. At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse. But as of last night, a police inspector said they didn't intend to forcibly evict anyone. \"We look forward to working with Occupy Philadelphia and a resolution of the problem,\" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Confrontation is never good.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 2099}
{"pred": "\n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle, expressed remorse and spiritual pain in a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church's Patriarch Kirill before his death in December 2013, at the age of 94. In the letter, published by the pro-Kremlin Izvestia newspaper, Kalashnikov questioned his role in taking lives with his invention and asked for forgiveness. He wrote, \"My spiritual pain is unbearable. I keep asking myself: if my rifle took people's lives, then can it be that it was I who... a Christian, who took innocent lives?\"\n\nKalashnikov, who was born in 1919, designed the AK-47 after experiencing the Red Army's lack of effective weapons during World War II. The rifle's simplicity and reliability made it a popular choice for military forces around the world. More than 100 million Kalashnikov rifles have been produced since its introduction in 1949.\n\nDespite its widespread use and the fame it brought him, Kalashnikov reportedly felt conflicted about the weapon's impact. He attended a church service at the age of 91 and was baptized later in life. In the letter, he wrote that he first went to church at the age of 91.\n\nThe AK-47 has been used in various conflicts and insurgencies, and its widespread availability has made it a symbol of armed resistance. However, its use in terrorist attacks and other violent crimes has raised concerns about its impact on global security.\n\nKalashnikov's funeral was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and other high-ranking officials. The Russian Orthodox Church has been seeking to consolidate its power and influence in Russian society since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kalashnikov's conversion and expression of remorse may reflect the changing religious landscape in Russia.\n\nAlexa Internet, a web traffic analysis company, has been donating its crawled data to the Internet Archive since 1996.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}
