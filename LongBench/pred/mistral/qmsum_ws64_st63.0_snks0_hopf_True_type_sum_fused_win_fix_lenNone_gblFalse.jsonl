She attributed this issue to a combination of factors, including the financial incentives not being enough to attract people, and the international issue of teacher recruitment and retention. She mentioned that they have set up an advisory board to look into the issue and have implemented new initiatives such as a national ITE recruitment marketing campaign and increasing financial incentives for priority subjects.

First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

They noted that using advanced chips and an LCD display would increase the costs significantly. However, they also considered the potential benefits of having an LCD display, such as easier use and a more modern design. Ultimately, they decided to explore both options, with one design featuring a scroll wheel and a regular chip, and the other design featuring an LCD display and an advanced chip. The team planned to further discuss the costs and feasibility of each design in the next meeting.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse.
