They also discussed the design process, which would involve three stages: functional design, aesthetic design, and technical design. The team also discussed the importance of keeping the remote compatible with various television brands and models. They also discussed the materials and technologies that could be used in the design. The team agreed to save the detailed design discussions for the next meeting and ended the meeting with instructions to research and gather ideas for the project.", "answers": ["The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project. They first got used to the writeboard and drew some animals with it.Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. Afterwards the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential. Among all the features, having a good look and size were unanimously considered to be the most essential."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6381}
{"pred": "Kirsty Williams acknowledged that there has been a trend of under-recruiting to teacher training places in Wales, with around 65% of targets being met in recent years. She attributed this issue to a combination of factors, including the international context, the perception of teaching as a profession, and the financial incentives offered in other countries. To address this issue, the Welsh Government has implemented a range of measures, including improving the quality of ITE provision, increasing financial incentives, and launching a national recruitment campaign. They are also exploring the possibility of part-time and flexible training options to make the profession more accessible.", "answers": ["Even though there was no specific figure that could be provided, they had only been recruiting about 65 percent of targets.Therefore, there was a lot of work they have to do about this. First, they were making sure that their ITE provision was world class, and recently they were through an accreditation process for a new ITE provision that would start in the next academic year. Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses. What's more, from next year, they would be going to have their unique part-time PGCE route into qualification, which allowed people to bring their outside world experience into teaching, and this could increase the diversity in their teaching workforce."], "all_classes": null, "length": 13883}
{"pred": "The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the design of the remote control. They noted that using advanced chips and an LCD display would increase the costs significantly. However, they also considered the benefits of having a scroll wheel and a menu button, which would require the use of advanced chips and an LCD display. Ultimately, they decided to explore both options, one with advanced chips and an LCD display, and the other without, to determine which one would be more cost-effective and appealing to their target audience.", "answers": ["Industrial Designer introduced both simple chips and advanced chips could be used for the mouse. But it would require the use of LCD display, which would highly increase the cost. Project Manager agreed that the LCD was easy when using the scroll buttons and could see the number. But Project Manager argued that young people were less likely to have their own room to afford a LCD TV and decided not to choose the advanced ones."], "all_classes": null, "length": 6036}
