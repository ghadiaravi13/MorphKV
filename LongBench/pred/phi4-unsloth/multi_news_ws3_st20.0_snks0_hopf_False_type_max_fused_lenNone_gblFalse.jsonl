Despite the looming deadline, police did not evict the protesters, and city officials remained non-committal about future actions. The protesters, many of whom are homeless, began dismantling their tents, with some planning to move to the Occupy site in Washington.

Police declared an unlawful assembly and ordered Occupy L.A. protesters to disperse from the streets surrounding City Hall. While no arrests were made initially, four demonstrators were later arrested for being present at an unlawful assembly. The Los Angeles encampment, one of the largest on the West Coast, had grown to roughly 400 tents and 700 to 800 people, with at least a third believed to be homeless. Despite the mayor's eviction order, police allowed the encampment to remain until at least daybreak, with no immediate plans for forcible removal.\n\nThe Occupy movement has seen varying degrees of accommodation from city officials. In Los Angeles, Mayor Villaraigosa had previously provided ponchos to campers during rain but ultimately ordered the encampment's removal after negotiations failed.

Brady, cited several factors in his decision, including newly discovered phone records that supported McCullough's long-held alibi that he was in Rockford, Illinois, attempting to enlist in the U.S. Air Force at the time of Maria's abduction. The case, one of the oldest unsolved U.S. cases ever to go to trial, had haunted the Sycamore community for decades. Maria's disappearance made headlines nationwide in the 1950s, when reports of child abductions were rare.

In his review, he found \"a wealth of information pointing to McCullough's innocence, and absolutely nothing showing guilt.\" Schmack also noted that Maria's friend had identified McCullough as the killer five decades later from an array of six photographs; McCullough's picture stood out, partially because everyone but him wore suitcoats and their photos were professional yearbook pictures.

{"pred": " \n\nCigarette smoke has been found to significantly increase the virulence and resistance of the superbug MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) to immune defenses, according to recent studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. The studies, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, reveal that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial components of the immune system's defense mechanisms. This increased resistance allows MRSA to better adhere to human cells, enhancing its ability to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe research indicates that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more difficult for immune cells, such as macrophages, to kill the bacteria. In laboratory tests, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be four times more resistant to macrophage killing compared to non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that the bacteria could pass on this enhanced resistance to their descendants.\n\nThe studies also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While both types of smoke increased the bacteria's resistance, cigarette smoke had a significantly more pronounced effect, making MRSA ten times more resistant than when exposed to e-cigarette vapor. The research further demonstrated that smoke-exposed MRSA was more lethal in mice, leading to higher mortality rates compared to non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThese findings challenge the prevailing theory that cigarette smoke primarily causes disease by harming the smoker. Instead, the studies suggest that smoke also makes pathogens like MRSA tougher, posing an additional risk to smokers who are already more susceptible to infectious diseases. The research underscores the importance of smoking cessation as a means to reduce the risk of severe infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria like MRSA.\n\nThe studies were conducted by a team of researchers from UC San Diego, the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, Utrecht University, and the University of Veterinary Medicine, Hannover, Germany. The research was funded in part by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. The findings highlight the dual threat posed by cigarette smoke: it not only damages human respiratory and immune cells but also enhances the virulence of dangerous pathogens, making infections more difficult to treat and control.", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

By employing methods akin to Google's PageRank algorithm, the team analyzed Wikipedia articles across 24 major language editions to determine the most important figures linked within the online encyclopedia. Surprisingly, Frank Sinatra emerged as the most important person in the English-language Wikipedia, with Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII following closely. However, when the analysis was expanded to include all language editions, Adolf Hitler was deemed the most important, with Michael Jackson and Madonna in second and third places, respectively.\n\nThe study aimed not just to rank individuals but to explore potential biases in Wikipedia's representation of historical figures, particularly concerning gender, time, and location. The findings indicated a Western-centric and male-dominated skew in the portrayal of significant historical figures. Despite this, each Wikipedia edition tended to highlight local figures, reflecting a natural cultural emphasis.\n\nThe researchers initially used PageRank, which assesses importance based on the number of significant pages linking to a given page. This method led to the unexpected conclusion that Carl Linnaeus, the 18th-century Swedish naturalist known for his work in taxonomy, was the most influential figure globally. This result was attributed to the extensive use of scientific names in Wikipedia articles, all tracing back to Linnaeus.\n\nTo address the peculiarities of PageRank, the team also employed CheiRank, which measures importance based on the number of outgoing links from a page. By combining PageRank and CheiRank into a 2DRank metric, the researchers refined their analysis, ultimately reaffirming Frank Sinatra's top position in the English-language Wikipedia.\n\nIn a parallel study, Eom's team sought to identify the most influential thinker by examining the branching web of links across Wikipedia's various language editions. Carl Linnaeus again topped the list, underscoring his enduring impact on scientific nomenclature.\n\nThese studies highlight the complexities and nuances of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, revealing both the strengths and limitations of algorithmic approaches in capturing the multifaceted nature of historical significance.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

In 2015, 21 cases were reported, and by August 2016, the number had risen to 50 cases across 24 states. \n\nAFM affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and its exact cause remains unknown. However, it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, and difficulty breathing or swallowing. There is no specific treatment for AFM, but neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. \n\nThe CDC has advised preventive measures such as frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces. Vaccinations are also crucial to prevent severe diseases like poliomyelitis, which can present with acute flaccid paralysis. \n\nThe rise in AFM cases has alarmed health officials and parents.

Recently, a forensic investigation conducted by researchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli has provided new insights into the authenticity of the shroud. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, utilized bloodstain pattern analysis to examine the blood-like splotches on the fabric. The researchers used both real and synthetic blood samples to replicate the blood flow on wounds depicted on the shroud, such as those on the left hand, forearms, chest, and lower back.\n\nThe findings revealed significant inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns. For instance, the angles at which blood would naturally flow from the wounds did not match the patterns seen on the shroud. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud could only be replicated if the model was standing upright, rather than lying flat or crucified. This suggests that the shroud may not be the burial cloth of Jesus, as traditionally believed, but rather a medieval artifact created using a standing model.\n\nThe study also highlighted the inconclusive nature of previous scientific analyses. Radiocarbon dating has dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE, during the Middle Ages, which contradicts the belief that it is from the time of Jesus. Additionally, the weave and fabric of the shroud are consistent with the Middle Ages, and previous research attempting to link the shroud to a Middle Eastern origin has been discredited.\n\nDespite these findings, the shroud remains a subject of fascination and debate. The Vatican regards it as an icon rather than a genuine religious relic, and it continues to attract millions of visitors. The forensic investigation adds to the body of evidence suggesting that the shroud is a medieval creation, but until scientists can definitively determine how the image was formed on the fabric, the mystery of the Shroud of Turin will persist.", "answers": ["The Shroud of Turin is supposedly the burial cloth that was wrapped around Jesus after his crucifixion; bloodstains on the linen shroud, which are said to have been transferred to it during the three days Jesus was in the tomb, form the image of a crucified man.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, the digs at Marden Henge and Wilsford Henge have revealed a wealth of artifacts and structures that date back over 4,000 years.\n\nAt Marden Henge, one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the country, archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic house. This rectangular structure, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period in the UK, was discovered on the edge of the henge, which has been largely buried under rich farmland. The house, which was likely used for temporary gatherings and feasts, was adorned with white chalk plaster and contained numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. The discovery of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggests that the house was not a permanent residence but was used for large gatherings.\n\nIn addition to the house, the site has yielded other significant finds, such as shale and copper bracelets, and the tiny jawbone of a vole. Analysis of seeds and charred grains will provide insights into the diet and agricultural practices of the people who lived there. The site, which once featured a massive enclosure with ramparts three meters high, is believed to have been a display of wealth and power, showcasing the ability to mobilize a large workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, archaeologists have unearthed a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton believed to be that of a child. The body, found in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, is undergoing scientific analysis to determine its gender, diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig aimed at understanding the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, has already produced numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch.\n\nThe findings from these excavations are expected to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric landscape and the people who inhabited it.

However, this surge in interest has led to concerns about overcrowding and environmental impact.\n\nThe PCT, which stretches 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has seen a steady increase in the number of hikers attempting the full trail. In 2016, over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits were issued, with more than 3,000 people attempting the Northbound thru-hike. The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015 to manage the growing number of hikers and mitigate environmental damage, particularly in the fragile desert ecosystems that dominate the first 700 miles of the trail.\n\nDespite these efforts, the trail is still experiencing overcrowding, with the maximum number of allowable hikers of 50 per day being reached during the high season.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team eventually led him to safety and found Mrs. Wilson's body approximately 150 meters below, having fallen 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff before tumbling further.\n\nThe inquest, led by John Gittins, the coroner for North Wales East and Central, concluded that Mrs. Wilson's death was accidental. It was noted that the light boots she wore were unsuitable for the rough terrain, potentially contributing to her fall. Det Con Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, emphasized that the route change was an attempt to avoid the summit but suggested that retreating the way they came or taking the North Ridge would have been safer.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to sugary drinks, was intended to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for community projects, and subsidize healthy food purchases for low-income families. However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and driving business outside city limits.\n\nThe tax has led to substantial price increases for sugary drinks. For example, a case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 before the tax now costs $26.33, a more than 64% increase. Retailers like Costco have responded by directing customers to locations outside Seattle where they can avoid the tax. This has resulted in a significant drop in sales within the city, as consumers choose to shop elsewhere.\n\nThe tax has also faced opposition from diverse groups, including labor unions, businesses, and even some public health advocates. Critics argue that the tax does not effectively promote healthier choices and instead creates economic burdens. The experience of Cook County, Illinois, which repealed its soda tax after a public outcry, serves as a cautionary tale for Seattle.\n\nDespite the backlash, Seattle officials remain committed to the tax, which is expected to generate $15 million in revenue this year.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

His defense team celebrated the decision, stating that Merritt had been wrongfully branded as a domestic terrorist.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy. Researchers have found that frequent use of acetaminophen by pregnant women may be associated with an increased risk of ADHD and similar disorders in their children. The studies, conducted in Denmark and published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of a child being diagnosed with ADHD or exhibiting ADHD-like behaviors. However, it is important to note that the studies did not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD. \n\nThe researchers found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy had a higher risk of having children diagnosed with ADHD. The study authors suggest that acetaminophen may interfere with maternal hormones critical for fetal brain development, citing previous studies done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. However, experts caution that the cited literature is not directly relevant to the human condition and that ADHD is a complex disorder with multiple risk factors, including genetic and environmental factors. \n\nDespite the concerns raised by the studies, experts emphasize that pregnant women should not stop taking acetaminophen altogether. They advise pregnant women to avoid chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen and to consult their doctors before taking any medication. Nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture, are also suggested as alternatives to help relieve pain during pregnancy. \n\nIn conclusion, while the studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, more research is needed to establish a clear cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

In Kenya, a male lion named Mohawk, known for his distinctive mane and popularity among tourists, was shot dead by rangers after it attacked a man in the Kajiado district. The incident occurred after Mohawk had escaped from Nairobi National Park, a protected area that is increasingly encroached upon by urban development. The decision to kill Mohawk, rather than tranquilize him, was made due to the immediate threat he posed to human life, as he had already injured a man and was surrounded by a large, agitated crowd. This event has sparked outrage among Kenyans, who have used social media to demand justice for the lion and question the actions of the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS).\n\nThe situation in Kenya is further complicated by the fact that Nairobi National Park is not fully fenced, allowing lions to roam freely into nearby towns and villages. This has led to multiple incidents of lions straying from the park, including another recent case where a lion mauled a pedestrian in Nairobi. The park's proximity to the city and the lack of adequate fencing have made it difficult to manage the lion population effectively. Additionally, infrastructure projects and noise from construction have disturbed the lions, prompting them to leave the park in search of quieter areas.\n\nIn South Africa, a similar situation unfolded with a lion named Sylvester, who escaped from Karoo National Park. Wildlife officials initially planned to kill Sylvester due to the threat he posed to humans, but public outcry led to a reconsideration of this decision. The South African parks service is now exploring various options, including relocating Sylvester to another park or improving the fencing at Karoo National Park.\n\nThese incidents underscore the challenges faced by wildlife authorities in balancing the protection of endangered species with the safety of human populations. The decline in lion populations over the past century, due to factors such as habitat loss and conflict with livestock herders, has made these decisions even more critical.

The vessel, less than an inch long and decorated with crosses, was believed by early Christians to have healing properties. John the Apostle's grave in Turkey was also a pilgrimage site for early Christians seeking healing.\n\nThe discovery was announced by Milen Nikolov, director of the Burgas Regional Museum of History, who described it as one of the museum's most important finds.

Although the planet itself has not been directly observed, its presence is inferred from the peculiar clustering and orbital paths of these smaller bodies.\n\nPlanet Nine is estimated to be five to ten times the mass of Earth and about two to four times its diameter, making it the fifth-largest planet in our solar system after Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. It is believed to orbit the sun at a distance 20 times farther than Neptune, which makes it extremely difficult to detect due to its faint reflection of sunlight.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is significant as it could reshape our understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution. Brown and Batygin's research builds on earlier work by astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo, who noted similar orbital behaviors in distant objects. The new study provides a more rigorous mathematical and computational basis for the existence of Planet Nine, increasing the likelihood of its eventual discovery.\n\nBrown, who gained notoriety for his role in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006, views the discovery of Planet Nine as a continuation of his work in understanding the outer solar system. He emphasizes the importance of accurate scientific classification and believes that Planet Nine's discovery will further clarify the solar system's structure.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on multiple continents scanning the skies for signs of the elusive planet. While the discovery is not guaranteed, the research has generated significant excitement in the astronomical community, with many experts confident that Planet Nine will eventually be observed directly.

CAD is a condition where the coronary arteries, responsible for supplying blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart, become damaged or diseased due to plaque buildup and inflammation. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and even heart attacks.\n\nThe studies, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore from the New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over five years. They found that those with the highest weight variability had significantly higher risks of new-onset diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and death compared to those with the lowest weight variability.

Dr. Bangalore noted that while losing weight is important, it is crucial to keep it off to avoid these severe health risks. The study also pointed out that the findings are observational and cannot definitively prove cause-and-effect, but they do raise significant concerns about weight fluctuation in individuals with CAD.\n\nIn addition to the findings on weight variability, the studies also discussed the broader implications of CAD, which is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, causing over 370,000 deaths annually.

He used the platform to address several pressing issues, including the controversy surrounding his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and allegations of his campaign's ties to Russia.\n\nTrump defended his administration's performance, asserting that despite media reports of chaos, his administration was running like a \"fine-tuned machine.\" He dismissed negative coverage as \"fake news\" and criticized the press for being dishonest and biased. Trump also took the opportunity to announce his new nominee for Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, and reiterated his commitment to repealing and replacing Obamacare.\n\nThroughout the conference, Trump frequently clashed with reporters, dismissing their questions and challenging their credibility. He accused the media of undermining public confidence and suggested that their negative coverage was part of a broader effort to discredit his presidency. Trump also addressed concerns about anti-Semitism, claiming that he was the least anti-Semitic person in the room, and defended his administration's stance on immigration and national security.\n\nDespite the contentious atmosphere, Trump attempted to project confidence and control, emphasizing his administration's accomplishments and future plans.

The problem was discovered on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down after reaching a pre-set temperature limit. This malfunction forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B, leading to a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. The crew, consisting of two Americans, three Russians, and a Japanese astronaut, had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nThe issue is believed to be caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Engineers are currently trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the problem or if a spacewalk will be necessary. The decision on whether an emergency spacewalk is required could take a couple of days or even weeks. If a spacewalk is needed, it would be part of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face occasionally during space station operations.\n\nDespite the cooling system problem, NASA has assured that the station and its crew were never in any danger.

Symptoms like anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits are critical warning signs.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological discovery at the Warratyi rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, southern Australia, has unveiled a human settlement dating back 49,000 years, making it one of the most significant prehistoric sites in Australia. This discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm and local Adnyamathanha elder Clifford Coulthard during a survey. The site contains evidence of human activity, including a blackened roof from ancient fires, sophisticated tools, and bone fragments from the largest marsupial ever, Diprotodon optatum. The findings suggest that Aboriginal Australians, the oldest continuous civilization, reached the arid interior of Australia much earlier than previously thought, around 49,000 years ago, challenging the consensus that they arrived 50,000 years ago.\n\nExcavation methods at the site involved meticulous hand excavation within two 2 × 1 m trenches, using a 1-m grid system subdivided into 25 cm square units for precision. The process included dry-sieving, detailed profile drawings, and careful recording of in situ finds. Optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of hearth charcoal and eggshell samples were used to determine the age of the site. Bayesian age modeling integrated all chronological data into a unified framework, confirming the site's age between 49,000 and 46,000 years.\n\nThe discovery at Warratyi provides the first reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including bones from juvenile Diprotodon and eggs from an ancient giant bird, suggesting humans hunted or scavenged these animals. The site also contains the earliest-known use of ochre and evidence of hafted axe technology, pushing back the dates for these technologies in Australia. This finding challenges the Eurocentric view of Indigenous Australian material culture as simplistic and highlights their ingenuity and adaptability.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for understanding human migration and adaptation in Australia, suggesting that humans moved through central Australia and used key technologies much earlier than previously thought. It also supports the idea that Aboriginal Australians adapted genetically to survive in the desert, as indicated by a recent genomic study. The Warratyi site is a milestone in the debate over the extinction of megafauna, providing evidence that humans lived alongside and possibly hunted these animals.\n\nOverall, the Warratyi rock shelter discovery is a groundbreaking find that reshapes our understanding of early human settlement and technological development in Australia, highlighting the remarkable adaptability and innovation of Aboriginal Australians. The site will be deposited at the SA Museum and an Adny", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Kardashev's model outlines three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I harnesses all the resources of a planet, Type II harnesses all the radiation of a star, and Type III harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. \n\nRecent research by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for civilizations to avoid being left alone in an ever-expanding universe. Hooper's paper, posted on arXiv.org, argues that the accelerating expansion of the universe due to dark energy will eventually make stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies and harvest their energy before they become unreachable. \n\nHooper proposes that such civilizations could use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and utilize a star's energy. These structures, first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and later proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, would consist of millions of solar-powered satellites forming a cloud around a star. The satellites, called \"statites,\" would hover in space by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun. \n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been popularized in science fiction, such as Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are currently at a Type I civilization level, with an estimated rating of 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, it is believed that there could be alien civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours that have already reached Type III. \n\nIn conclusion, the news passages explore the idea of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from stars and galaxies to survive in an ever-expanding universe.

Initially, she showed remarkable resilience, quickly transitioning from needing oxygen support to breathing independently. However, her health took a turn for the worse when she developed a severe urinary tract infection (UTI) that likely spread to her kidneys. Despite initial treatment with antibiotics, the infection recurred, leading to the discovery of stage 3 kidney reflux, a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys, increasing the risk of infections.\n\nComplicating her condition, Oakleigh contracted a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that can cause serious infections, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. This infection, coupled with her kidney issues, has made her treatment challenging. Pseudomonas infections are notorious for their resistance to many antibiotics, making them difficult to treat, especially in hospital settings where the bacteria can spread through various means.\n\nIn addition to her kidney and infection issues, Oakleigh was diagnosed with moderate atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary stenosis, heart conditions that are particularly concerning given her overall health status. These conditions necessitate careful monitoring and further testing by a cardiologist.\n\nDespite these challenges, Oakleigh is scheduled for surgery to address the reflux in her left kidney, which has reduced functionality.

Jon Stewart, a stand-up comedian and former host of The Jon Stewart Show, was eventually chosen despite initial skepticism from Comedy Central executives. Stewart's vision for the show was to shift from spoofing headlines to making fun of the news itself, emphasizing a more pointed and purposeful approach.\n\nThe transition was not smooth, as Stewart faced resistance from the existing writers who were accustomed to Kilborn's style. Stewart's insistence on a new direction led to conflicts, including a notable \"fuck-you meeting\" where he asserted his authority.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological findings in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have significantly altered our understanding of early human behavior and technological advancement. These discoveries, reported in three papers published in the journal Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in the East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives during the Middle Stone Age.\n\nThe excavated Middle Stone Age tools, which are the oldest of their kind at roughly 320,000 years old, indicate a long trend of climate-driven behavior changes in members of the Homo genus. These changes included foraging over larger areas with increasingly smaller tools, as food sources became unpredictable due to changing landscapes. The tools, including spearpoints and other small implements struck from prepared chunks of stone, were made from obsidian sourced from distances of 25 to 50 kilometers away, suggesting long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations.\n\nThe findings also reveal that the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age involved significant technological innovation. Older sites yielded large, bulky stone tools such as hand axes and cleavers, while the Middle Stone Age sites contained much smaller, standardized pieces such as points and blades. Some of these tools were made at the site, indicating a shift in toolmaking practices.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery of bright red ochre pigment with evidence of grinding and cut marks marks the earliest known use of pigments to color rocks in the archaeological record. This, along with the long-distance transport of raw materials like obsidian, suggests the presence of expanded social networks, transmission of information, and technological innovation.\n\nThese findings challenge the previously held belief that modern behaviors such as symbolism, innovation, and art arose suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago during a \"human revolution.\" Instead, they indicate that such behaviors emerged much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species. The evidence from Olorgesailie Basin highlights the role of climate change in driving technological and cultural adaptations, suggesting that early humans were capable of complex behaviors and social networking long before the advent of modern humans.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide crucial insights into the evolution of early human behavior and the development of modern cognitive abilities, emphasizing the importance of environmental factors in shaping human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The Russian Embassy criticized Canada for allowing Katriuk to live peacefully in the country, while Jewish organizations expressed disappointment that he will not face justice. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, on the other hand, urged Canada to ignore Russia's demands, viewing them as a distraction from Russia's actions in Ukraine. \n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his life, Katriuk's lawyer stated that he had been a victim of unfair persecution and had been suffering from health issues for a long time.

This move, which has been in discussion for decades, marks a pivotal shift in the country's drug policy. The new law, passed by Jamaican lawmakers, reduces possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana to a petty offense, avoiding criminal records for individuals caught with small quantities. Additionally, the cultivation of up to five plants on any premises is now permitted.\n\nThis legislative change is not just about decriminalization; it also sets the stage for the development of a regulated medical cannabis industry. A licensing authority will be established to oversee the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This move is expected to position Jamaica as a player in the burgeoning global medical marijuana market, potentially boosting health tourism and the creation of innovative cannabis-derived products.\n\nFor Rastafarians, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament, this law is a significant victory for religious freedom. It allows them to use marijuana legally for religious purposes for the first time. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad can also apply for permits to purchase small amounts of ganja legally.\n\nDespite these changes, the Jamaican government remains firm on its stance against transnational drug trafficking and illegal cultivation. National Security Minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the new law does not equate to a free-for-all in the growing, transporting, dealing, or exporting of marijuana. The security forces will continue to enforce Jamaican law rigorously, in line with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe international community, particularly the United States, has expressed its position on the matter. While acknowledging Jamaica's sovereign right to legislate its drug laws, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Counter-Narcotics Affairs William Brownfield reiterated that trafficking marijuana into the U.S. remains illegal. He expects Jamaica to uphold its commitments under the UN Drug Conventions to combat drug trafficking.\n\nThis legislative change in Jamaica is part of a broader trend of easing marijuana restrictions worldwide. Several U.S. states have legalized medical and recreational marijuana, and countries like Uruguay and Argentina have also relaxed their marijuana laws. Jamaica's move is seen as a progressive step towards correcting the historical criminalization of its citizens, particularly young black males and Rastafarians, for minor marijuana offenses.

{"pred": " \n\nMars, once a warm and wet planet, had a massive ancient ocean that covered nearly half of its northern hemisphere, making it a promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. This ocean, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, was a mile deep in places and held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, more than is found in the Arctic Ocean. The evidence for this primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nScientists used three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world to study Mars and make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. Martian water, like that on Earth, contains standard water molecules, made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and another form of water made with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. On Mars, water containing normal hydrogen is lost to space over time, but the heavier form is left behind. When normal water is lost on Mars, the concentration of deuterium in water left behind goes up. The process can be used to infer how much water there used to be on the planet. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water has been lost.\n\nThe infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet’s frozen ice caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet’s surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth’s surface.\n\nThe huge body of water lasted for millions of years. But over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned. The drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé failed to prove that the shape was recognized as distinctive by consumers in a sufficient number of EU countries, including Belgium, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal.\n\nThis ruling not only affects Nestlé but also opens the door for other companies to produce similar products without infringing on the KitKat trademark. For instance, Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, a similar four-fingered chocolate bar, could now be produced and sold without legal repercussions.

However, recent research suggests that these depictions are far from accurate. Contrary to the fearsome roars we are accustomed to, dinosaurs likely did not sound like that. Instead, they may have produced sounds more akin to the coo of a pigeon or the mumble of an ostrich, as indicated by a study published in the journal Evolution.\n\nThe study, which involved researchers from universities in Texas, Arizona, Utah, and Canada, analyzed the vocalizations of living birds and crocodiles, which are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. They found that many birds produce \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" which are low, throaty whooshes of air emitted through an esophageal pouch rather than an open beak. This type of vocalization is common in large-bodied birds such as doves, ostriches, and the New Zealand cassowary, suggesting that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had similar vocal abilities.\n\nGary Rydstrom, the sound designer for Jurassic Park, created the iconic dinosaur sounds by blending various animal noises, including those of baby elephants, tigers, and alligators. Despite the creative process, the resulting sounds were purely fictional and not based on scientific evidence. Rydstrom's work highlights the challenge of recreating dinosaur sounds without direct fossil evidence of their vocal organs.\n\nThe study also suggests that closed-mouth vocalization evolved independently at least 16 times within the bird lineage, predominantly in large-bodied species. This behavior is rare in small-bodied passerines. Given the body size trends in nonavian dinosaurs, it is likely that some extinct dinosaurs had the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization, possibly during mating displays.\n\nIn conclusion, while the roaring dinosaurs of Hollywood have captured our imaginations, scientific research indicates that the real sounds of dinosaurs were likely much more subdued and bird-like. This new understanding challenges long-held perceptions and offers a glimpse into a more nuanced and fascinating prehistoric world.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent breakthrough by researchers at UC Berkeley has brought us closer to the possibility of reading and reconstructing visual experiences directly from the brain. In a groundbreaking study, scientists have successfully pieced together YouTube videos from the brain activity of subjects who watched the same videos while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. This experiment marks a significant advancement in understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, as it is the first time a continuous, dynamic visual experience has been reconstructed from brain patterns.\n\nThe study involved subjects, including the researchers themselves, who spent hours inside an MRI machine watching sets of movie trailers. The MRI recorded the blood flow in the visual cortex, which processes visual information. This data was then used to develop a \"movie reconstruction algorithm\" that matched neural activity with the dynamic information in the videos, such as shapes, images, and sounds. The algorithm was trained on 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, allowing it to associate specific neural patterns with visual content.\n\nOnce the algorithm was developed, it was used to reconstruct videos based on the brain activity recorded during the second viewing of the trailers. The resulting videos were continuous but abstract, resembling a Surrealist painting with a dream-like quality. This continuous reconstruction of dynamic visual experiences is a significant leap from previous capabilities, which were limited to static images.\n\nThe implications of this research are profound. It opens the door to potentially seeing what is happening in the mind without external visual stimuli, such as dreams and thoughts. The technology could eventually be used to broadcast internal imagery, providing insights into dreams, memories, and even fantasies. This could have applications in helping paralyzed individuals control their environment by imagining movements or in communication for those with paralyzing conditions.\n\nHowever, the technology is still in its early stages. The brain activity measured in this study represents only a fraction of the activity involved in seeing moving images. The brain consists of numerous modules, each responsible for different aspects of visual processing. Future research aims to build models for each part of the visual system, which would improve the resolution of reconstructed images and require significant computational power.\n\nWhile the potential applications are exciting, there are ethical and practical considerations. The use of this technology in legal contexts, such as detective work or court cases, raises questions about the reliability and interpretation of reconstructed memories. As the researchers themselves acknowledge, an accurate read-out of a faulty memory would only provide misleading information.\n\nIn summary, the UC Berkeley study represents a major step forward in understanding and reconstructing visual experiences from brain activity.

Using the scans they were then able to reproduce the videos—though they’re blurry. “This is a major leap,” the co-author says. He thinks the technique could eventually be used to reconstruct dreams or memories, if it turns out the brain processes those things similarly to how it processes movies. “It’s our next line of research.” (More details on how the experiment worked, along with a video, at PC Magazine.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1188}

The scandal involves the creation of millions of fake accounts by Wells Fargo employees to meet sales targets, resulting in a $185 million penalty for the bank. Warren accused Stumpf of benefiting personally from the scandal, with his stock holdings gaining over $200 million during the period in question. She criticized Stumpf's leadership and called for accountability, suggesting that he should return the money he earned during the scandal and face criminal charges. Other senators also questioned Stumpf about the bank's actions, including whether the bank would claw back bonuses paid to former executive Carrie Tolstedt and how the bank would help customers whose credit ratings were affected by the fake accounts. Stumpf defended the bank's cross-selling practices, stating that they were aimed at deepening customer relationships rather than inflating the bank's stock price.\n\nThe second topic involves the U.S. decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a move expected to be announced by President Donald Trump. This decision is seen as a compromise, as Trump had previously pledged to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, which would have sparked a greater international backlash. The administration plans to sign another six-month waiver, delaying the embassy move. The decision has been met with criticism from various quarters, including Pope Francis, who called for the status quo in Jerusalem to be respected. The recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's \"undivided\" capital is likely to complicate peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. The decision comes amidst a broader shift in Middle East politics, with Saudi Arabia reportedly presenting a peace plan more favorable to Israel than previous U.S. proposals. The plan would grant Palestinians a noncontiguous state with limited sovereignty and no right of return for refugees, while allowing most Israeli settlements in the West Bank to remain.

Despite extensive search efforts, the plane's location and the cause of its disappearance remain unknown. Bayesian statistical methods, which have been successfully used in past search operations such as the hunt for Air France Flight 447, are being considered to refine the search for MH370. These methods involve updating probability estimates based on new information, allowing searchers to focus on the most likely areas where the plane might be found.\n\nBayesian statisticians, like those from Metron Scientific Solutions, have previously assisted in locating missing aircraft by creating probability distributions over search areas. For instance, in the search for Air France Flight 447, Bayesian methods helped identify the most probable location of the wreckage, leading to its discovery after multiple failed attempts. These methods take into account various factors, including historical data, search patterns, and new evidence, to continuously update the probability map.\n\nIn the case of MH370, the search is complicated by the possibility of a deliberate diversion, which shifts the focus to areas farther from the plane's last known location. Bayesian techniques allow for the integration of this new information, adjusting the probability map accordingly. However, some experts, like Stanford University statistician Bradley Efron, argue that the drastic changes in new evidence make Bayesian methods less suitable for this search.\n\nDespite these challenges, Bayesian methods offer a structured approach to handling the uncertainties and complexities of the search.

Despite several visual and one audible hands-on warning, the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds prior to the collision. The vehicle logs indicated that no action was taken by the driver, who had about five seconds and 150 meters of unobstructed view of the concrete divider with the crushed crash attenuator.\n\nThe severity of the crash was attributed to the crash attenuator, a highway safety barrier designed to reduce impact, which had been crushed in a prior accident and not replaced. Tesla emphasized that this level of damage to a Model X had never been seen in any other crash. Walter Huang's family revealed that he had previously complained to the dealership about the vehicle veering toward the same barrier during Autopilot use, but the issue could not be replicated there.\n\nTesla's statement highlighted the safety benefits of Autopilot, noting that it reduces crash rates by up to 40% and that Tesla vehicles equipped with Autopilot hardware are 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident compared to the national average. The company stressed that while Autopilot does not prevent all accidents, it significantly enhances safety for vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and cyclists. Tesla also pointed out the potential global impact of widespread Autopilot use, suggesting it could save approximately 900,000 lives per year if the current safety level of Tesla vehicles were applied universally.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Highway Patrol (CHP) are investigating the accident, focusing on the data from the vehicle's restraint control module and infotainment module.

{"pred": " \n\nThe news passages provide a comprehensive overview of the political and social climate in Egypt during the early stages of its transition following the ouster of former President Hosni Mubarak. The country was in the midst of its first parliamentary elections since Mubarak's removal, with the final round of voting taking place across nine provinces, including the North and South Sinai governorates. The elections were significant as they were the first since the revolution that led to Mubarak's downfall in February 2011.\n\nThe Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was leading the polls, with expectations of securing a majority in the new parliament. This was a notable shift in power, as Islamist groups were consolidating their gains from earlier rounds of voting. The Brotherhood's potential majority raised concerns among Egyptian liberals and Western observers about the possibility of an Islamist-dominated government. However, the Brotherhood expressed intentions to form a coalition or unity government, aiming to include various political factions and alleviate fears of an Islamist takeover.\n\nThe trial of Hosni Mubarak was also a focal point during this period. Mubarak faced charges of complicity in the killing of protesters during the uprising and corruption. The prosecution portrayed him as a tyrant responsible for violence and oppression, seeking the harshest penalty for his actions. The trial was seen as a test of accountability for former rulers in Egypt.\n\nAmidst these political developments, Egypt was experiencing economic challenges, with slowing growth, declining foreign-currency reserves, and a significant drop in the stock market. The unrest had deterred tourists and investors, further exacerbating the economic situation.\n\nThe military, which had taken control after Mubarak's ouster, was also a significant player in the unfolding events. There was tension between the military rulers and the newly elected parliament, particularly regarding the distribution of power and the formation of the interim government. The military had scheduled the first session of the lower house of Parliament for January 23, coinciding with the anniversary of the protests that led to Mubarak's resignation.\n\nIn summary, Egypt was navigating a complex transition marked by political shifts, economic challenges, and the quest for accountability and justice in the wake of the revolution. The outcomes of the parliamentary elections and Mubarak's trial were closely watched as indicators of the country's future direction.user\nYou are given several news passages.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
