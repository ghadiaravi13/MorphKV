The studies, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, reveal that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial components of the immune system's defense mechanisms. This increased resistance allows MRSA to better adhere to human cells, enhancing its ability to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe research indicates that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more difficult for immune cells, such as macrophages, to kill the bacteria. In laboratory tests, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be four times more resistant to macrophage killing compared to non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that the bacteria could pass on this enhanced resistance to their descendants.\n\nThe studies also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While both types of smoke increased the bacteria's resistance, cigarette smoke had a significantly more pronounced effect, making MRSA ten times more resistant than when exposed to e-cigarette vapor. In animal models, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke caused a significant increase in mortality compared to non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes pathogens like MRSA more aggressive and difficult to treat.

Surprisingly, Frank Sinatra emerged as the most important person in the English-language Wikipedia, with Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII following closely. However, when the analysis was expanded to include all language editions, Adolf Hitler was deemed the most important, with Michael Jackson and Madonna in second and third places, respectively.\n\nThe study aimed not just to rank individuals but to explore potential biases in Wikipedia's representation of historical figures, particularly concerning gender, time, and location. The findings indicated a Western-centric and male-dominated skew in the portrayal of significant historical figures. Despite this, each Wikipedia edition tended to highlight local figures, reflecting a natural cultural emphasis.\n\nThe researchers initially used PageRank, which assesses importance based on the number of significant pages linking to a given page.

Recently, a forensic investigation conducted by researchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli has cast further doubt on its authenticity. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, utilized bloodstain pattern analysis to examine the blood-like stains on the shroud. The researchers used both real and synthetic blood to replicate the patterns on a live subject and a mannequin, focusing on wounds depicted on the shroud, such as those on the left hand, forearms, chest, and lower back.\n\nTheir findings revealed significant inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns. For instance, the angles and directions of the blood flow on the shroud did not match those that would occur if the stains were made by a body lying flat on the fabric. The researchers noted that the bloodstains on the shroud suggested a standing model rather than a crucified man. Specifically, the angles of the blood flow on the left hand and forearms were inconsistent with the supposed position of the body. The study also found that the blood flow from a simulated spear wound in the chest did not align with the patterns on the shroud, whether the subject was upright or prone.\n\nRadiocarbon dating has previously dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE, suggesting it is a medieval artifact rather than a genuine burial cloth from the time of Jesus. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon rather than a relic, and the church has not officially weighed in on its authenticity.

The Malaysian police chief, Khalid Abu Bakar, confirmed the use of VX based on preliminary toxicology reports, which detected the agent on Kim's eyes and face. The attack involved two women, one Indonesian and one Vietnamese, who allegedly smeared the nerve agent on Kim's face in a crowded airport terminal. Both women have been arrested, and Malaysia is seeking the extradition of several North Korean suspects, including an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline and a diplomat from the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe incident has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea. North Korea has vehemently denied any involvement, accusing Malaysia of colluding with South Korea and demanding the return of Kim Jong Nam's body. In response, Malaysia has expelled the North Korean ambassador and barred North Korean officials from leaving the country. The use of VX, a banned chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention, has raised serious concerns about public safety, as the substance is deadly even in minute quantities and can remain active on surfaces for extended periods.\n\nKim Jong Nam, who lived in exile in Macau, was once considered a potential successor to his father, Kim Jong Il, but fell out of favor and lived abroad for years. He was known for his criticism of the North Korean regime and had reportedly expressed a desire to see reforms in the country. His assassination has led to widespread speculation about the involvement of the North Korean government, given the regime's history of using chemical weapons and conducting assassinations abroad.\n\nThe case has perplexed toxicologists and international observers, as the two women accused of carrying out the attack reportedly suffered no ill effects from handling the nerve agent.

Led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, the digs at Marden Henge and Wilsford Henge have revealed a wealth of artifacts and structures that date back over 4,000 years.\n\nAt Marden Henge, one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the country, archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic house. This rectangular structure, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period in the UK, was discovered on the edge of the henge, which has been largely buried under rich farmland. The house, which was likely used for temporary gatherings and feasts, was adorned with white chalk plaster and contained numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. The discovery of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggests that the house was not a permanent residence but was used for large gatherings.\n\nIn addition to the house, the site has yielded other significant finds, such as shale and copper bracelets, and the tiny jawbone of a vole. Analysis of seeds and charred grains will provide insights into the diet and agricultural practices of the people who lived there. The site, which once featured a massive enclosure with ramparts three meters high, is believed to have been a display of wealth and power, showcasing the ability to mobilize a large workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, archaeologists have unearthed a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton believed to be that of a child. The body, found in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, is undergoing scientific analysis to determine its gender, diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig aimed at understanding the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, has already produced numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch.\n\nThe findings from these excavations are expected to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric landscape and the people who inhabited it.

Despite BP's substantial $5.2 billion loss that year, Dudley's total remuneration package reached $19.6 million, a decision that has faced strong opposition from investors. Shareholders have criticized the pay rise as being out of touch with the company's financial performance and the broader industry trend of reducing executive pay amid falling oil prices.\n\nThe shareholder rebellion is notable, with over 59% voting against the executive pay decisions at BP's annual general meeting, marking one of the largest rejections of a corporate pay package in the UK. This vote, although non-binding, signals a growing trend of institutional investors taking a more aggressive stance on executive compensation, especially when it does not align with company performance or shareholder interests.\n\nBP's board, led by Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg, has defended the pay increase, citing Dudley's leadership in navigating the company through challenging times, including the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the ongoing low oil price environment. They argue that Dudley's compensation is in line with his responsibilities and the company's strategic objectives.\n\nHowever, the backlash from shareholders has prompted the board to consider reviewing its compensation policies.

However, this surge in interest has raised concerns about overcrowding and the potential negative impact on the trail and its environment.\n\nThe PCT, which stretches 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has seen a steady increase in the number of hikers attempting the full trail. In 2016, over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits were issued, with more than 3,000 hikers attempting the northbound thru-hike. This is a significant increase from the 300 hikers who attempted the full trail in 2006, the year Strayed completed her hike.\n\nTo manage the growing number of hikers and mitigate environmental damage, the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day. This system aims to spread out hikers and reduce wear and tear on the trail, particularly in the fragile desert environments that dominate the first 700 miles of the trail.\n\nDespite these efforts, concerns about overcrowding persist. Many hikers have reported encountering large groups of other hikers, particularly in the early sections of the trail. This has led to increased competition for resources, such as water and campsites, and has raised concerns about the impact on the trail's environment and the experience of hikers.\n\nIn addition to the environmental impact, the increase in hikers has also led to a rise in the number of search and rescue operations.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

{"pred": " \n\nSeattle's new sweetened beverage tax, which took effect on January 1, 2018, has sparked significant controversy and debate. The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the cost of sugary drinks, was introduced with the intention of reducing sugar consumption, raising revenue for community projects, and subsidizing healthy food for low-income families. Former Mayor Ed Murray touted it as a progressive measure, but the tax has faced strong opposition from various groups, including businesses, labor unions, and even some public health advocates.\n\nThe tax has led to a substantial increase in the price of sugary beverages. For example, a case of Gatorade at Costco saw its price jump by over 64%, prompting customers to seek alternatives outside the city limits. This exodus has resulted in a significant loss of revenue for Seattle, as residents and businesses alike have shifted their purchasing habits to avoid the tax. The situation mirrors what happened in Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois, where similar taxes were repealed due to public backlash and economic impact.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals who are more likely to purchase sugary drinks. They also point out that the tax does not apply uniformly, exempting certain beverages like milk-based drinks and those sold in restaurants, which undermines its effectiveness and fairness. Furthermore, the tax has been criticized for its potential to harm local businesses, as seen in the case of Costco, which has openly directed customers to its suburban locations to avoid the tax.\n\nDespite the controversy, some public health advocates support the tax, arguing that it can lead to healthier consumption habits and generate funds for beneficial community programs.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

The House of Representatives, led by Speaker John Boehner, passed a plan to fund the government through December 15, but with conditions attached, including delaying the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. This move was seen as an attempt to appease conservative members of the Republican Party who were opposed to the ACA.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by Democrats, was expected to reject the House's proposal, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Barack Obama both stated they would not negotiate over the ACA. Reid urged the Senate to pass a clean funding bill without any conditions attached to it, which would then be sent back to the House. The impasse was largely due to the Republican strategy to use the funding bill as leverage to defund or delay the ACA.\n\nThe potential shutdown was a significant concern for the Washington, D.C. region, which is heavily reliant on federal employment and contracting. Local economists projected that a shutdown could cost the region $200 million a day and affect over 700,000 jobs. Essential services like mail delivery and Amtrak trains were expected to continue, but many federal employees would be furloughed, and non-essential services would be halted.\n\nThe political standoff highlighted the deep divisions between the two parties over healthcare reform and fiscal policy.

{"pred": " \n\nAstronomer Mike Brown, known as the \"Pluto killer,\" has been instrumental in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet and is now part of a team that has found compelling evidence for a ninth planet in our solar system, tentatively named Planet Nine. Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, has discovered over 30 dwarf planets and played a key role in the demotion of Pluto in 2006 after the discovery of Eris, a similar-sized object in the Kuiper Belt. This reclassification sparked controversy and debate, with some arguing for Pluto's reinstatement as a planet. Despite the backlash, Brown has embraced his role in the reclassification, emphasizing the importance of understanding the solar system as it truly is.\n\nThe latest research, co-authored by Brown and Konstantin (Konstantin) Konstantinov, suggests that Planet Nine is a gas giant, possibly ten times the mass of Earth, orbiting the sun at a distance of 400 to 800 astronomical units (AU). The evidence for Planet Nine's existence comes from the unusual orbits of several distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, which suggest they are being influenced by a large, unseen planet. The team used computer simulations to show that the orbits of these objects could be explained by the gravitational pull of a ninth planet.\n\nBrown and his colleagues have not yet directly observed Planet Nine, but they are confident in its existence due to the mathematical models and simulations that support their hypothesis. They anticipate that the planet could be discovered within the next few years with the help of powerful telescopes. The discovery of Planet Nine would not only add a new member to our solar system but also provide insights into its formation and evolution.\n\nThe debate over Pluto's status has continued, with some scientists and the public still advocating for its reinstatement as a planet. However, Brown argues that the focus should be on the new discoveries and the broader understanding of the solar system, rather than on the classification of Pluto. He believes that the controversy over Pluto's status will eventually subside as the scientific community and the public come to terms with the new reality of our solar system.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of evidence for a ninth planet has reignited interest in the outer reaches of our solar system and has highlighted the dynamic nature of astronomical classification. Mike Brown's work has been central to these developments, and his research continues to shape our understanding of the cosmos.\n", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

CAD is a condition where the coronary arteries, responsible for supplying blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart, become damaged or diseased due to plaque buildup and inflammation. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and even heart attacks.\n\nThe studies, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore from the New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over five years. They found that those with the highest weight variability had significantly higher risks of new-onset diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. Specifically, the highest weight variability group had a 78% higher risk of diabetes, 117% higher risk of heart attacks, 136% higher risk of strokes, and 124% higher risk of death.\n\nThe research, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a stable weight rather than experiencing large fluctuations. Dr. Bangalore noted that while losing weight is important, it is crucial to keep it off to avoid these severe health risks. The study also pointed out that the findings are observational and cannot definitively prove cause-and-effect, but they do raise significant concerns about weight fluctuation in individuals with CAD.\n\nIn addition to the findings on weight variability, the studies also discussed the broader implications of CAD, which is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, causing over 370,000 deaths annually. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can block blood flow to the heart.\n\nOverall, the research underscores the need for further investigation into how to help individuals with CAD maintain a stable weight and avoid the detrimental effects of yo-yo dieting.

The crew, consisting of two Americans, three Russians, and a Japanese astronaut, had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nThe issue is believed to be caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Engineers are currently trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the problem or if a spacewalk will be necessary. The decision on whether an emergency spacewalk is required could take a couple of days or even weeks. If a spacewalk is needed, it would be part of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face occasionally during space station operations.\n\nDespite the cooling system problem, NASA has assured that the station and its crew were never in any danger. The life support system is still operational, and the crew has been working to keep critical systems running. The current mission, officially called Expedition 38, is scheduled to continue until March 2014.\n\nThe ISS, which has been continuously occupied since 2000, is a partnership of 16 nations and is planned to be maintained through 2020, with discussions already underway to extend its operating life. The station relies heavily on external cooling loops that circulate ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool. The malfunctioning loop was producing too much ammonia, prompting the shutdown of some non-critical systems.\n\nThis is not the first time the ISS has faced cooling system issues. Spacewalkers have dealt with similar problems in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2007. In May, NASA astronauts conducted a spacewalk to replace a leaky coolant pump control box after just two days of planning. U.S. spacewalks were temporarily suspended after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's spacesuit filled with water during a July outing, but Russian spacewalks have proceeded without problems. Since then, NASA has made significant progress on resolving the spacesuit issue.\n\nOverall, while the cooling", "answers": ["NASA is reporting a glitch with one of the two cooling pumps on the International Space Station, but it says none of the six crew members are in danger, reports CNN.

The University of Michigan study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, analyzed data from nearly 260,000 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011. The findings revealed that 15% of these patients were younger than 50, and these younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. Despite this, younger patients often received more aggressive treatment and had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients.\n\nThe study highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening guidelines for younger adults. Current guidelines recommend starting colorectal cancer screening at age 50, but the study suggests that nearly 15% of patients could be diagnosed late if these guidelines are not adjusted. In comparison, breast cancer screening begins at age 40, with less than 5% of cases occurring in women under 40.\n\nExperts emphasize the importance of recognizing symptoms such as anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits, which can be early warning signs of colorectal cancer. While not all bowel bleeding indicates cancer, dark blood mixed with stool is a significant warning sign. Family history and other risk factors should prompt earlier screening, but the study indicates that this is not consistently practiced.\n\nThe rise in colorectal cancer among younger adults is not fully understood, but environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and poor diet may contribute. Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School suggests that these risk factors should be considered when evaluating younger patients for potential early-onset colorectal cancer.\n\nThe findings raise questions about whether screening guidelines should be revised to start earlier than age 50. However, experts caution that more research is needed to determine if earlier screening would effectively reduce cancer deaths. The study underscores the importance of preparing for an increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support to manage the physical and psychological impacts of their disease and treatment.\n\nIn conclusion, the growing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals calls for a reevaluation of current screening practices and increased awareness of early symptoms and risk factors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": " \n\nThe news passages discuss the concept of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from stars and galaxies, as proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. Kardashev's model outlines three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I harnesses all the resources of a planet, Type II harnesses all the radiation of a star, and Type III harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. \n\nRecent research by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for civilizations to avoid being left alone in an ever-expanding universe. Hooper's paper, posted on arXiv.org, argues that the accelerating expansion of the universe due to dark energy will eventually make stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies and harvest their energy before they become unreachable. \n\nHooper proposes that such civilizations could use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and utilize a star's energy. These structures, first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and later proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, would consist of millions of solar-powered satellites forming a spherical shell around a star. The satellites would hover in space, collecting energy and beaming it back to the home planet. \n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been a popular theme in science fiction, appearing in works such as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker,\" Larry Niven's \"Ringworld,\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" \n\nWhile humans are currently at a Type I civilization level, with an estimated rating of 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, some scientists believe that there could be alien civilizations thousands or even millions of years older than ours that have already reached Type III. Detecting these advanced civilizations may be possible by observing unusual light signatures from galaxies where stars have been harvested. However, current instruments may not be precise enough to detect these signatures. \n\nIn summary, the news passages explore the idea of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from stars and galaxies to survive in an ever-expanding universe, with the concept of Dyson spheres playing a central role in this energy-harvesting strategy.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological findings in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have significantly altered our understanding of early human behavior and technological advancement. These discoveries, reported in three papers published in the journal Science, suggest that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed advanced tool-making techniques and established long-distance trading networks as early as 320,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe Olorgesailie Basin, a region that underwent dramatic climatic shifts, served as a catalyst for these advancements. The unpredictable climate likely drove early humans to innovate and adapt, leading to the development of smaller, more standardized tools known as Middle Stone Age industries. These tools, made from obsidian and other materials, were found to be significantly different from the larger, bulkier Acheulean tools used by earlier hominins.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of these findings is the evidence of long-distance trade. Obsidian used in the tools was sourced from locations up to 50 kilometers away, indicating that early humans had established extensive social networks and engaged in the exchange of materials over considerable distances. This behavior suggests a level of social complexity and cooperation previously not attributed to such early periods.\n\nAdditionally, the discovery of red ochre pigment at the site, used for coloring tools and possibly for symbolic purposes, points to the early use of symbolic thought and cultural expression. This pigment, along with the advanced tools, marks the Olorgesailie Basin as a significant site for understanding the cognitive and cultural evolution of early humans.\n\nThese findings challenge the traditional view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolic thought and complex tool-making, emerged only around 50,000 years ago during the so-called \"human revolution.\" Instead, they suggest that these behaviors developed much earlier, possibly in response to environmental pressures and the need for adaptation.\n\nIn summary, the archaeological discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide compelling evidence that early humans were capable of significant technological and cultural advancements much earlier than previously believed. These findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in driving human evolution and underscore the complexity of early human societies. The research not only redefines our understanding of the timeline of human development but also emphasizes the role of climate and social networks in shaping the course of human history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

{"pred": " \n\nJamaica has made a significant legislative change by decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, known locally as ganja. This move, which has been in discussion for decades, marks a pivotal shift in the country's drug policy. The new law, passed by Jamaican lawmakers, reduces possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana to a petty offense, avoiding criminal records for individuals caught with small quantities. Additionally, the cultivation of up to five plants is now permitted, reflecting the drug's deep cultural roots in Jamaica.\n\nThe legislation also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This development opens the door for Jamaica to become a player in the burgeoning medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the creation of innovative cannabis-derived products. Local scientists have already made strides in this area, with products like \"Canasol,\" which helps alleviate glaucoma symptoms.\n\nFor the first time, Rastafarians can legally use marijuana for religious purposes, aligning with the spiritual practices of the movement founded in Jamaica in the 1930s. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad can also apply for permits to purchase ganja legally.\n\nDespite these changes, the Jamaican government maintains a firm stance against transnational drug trafficking and illegal cultivation. National security minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the new law does not equate to a free-for-all in marijuana activities. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce laws against trafficking and illegal cultivation, in line with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe U.S. has acknowledged Jamaica's sovereign right to amend its drug laws, though it remains clear that trafficking marijuana into the U.S. is illegal. This legislative change aligns Jamaica with a global trend of easing marijuana restrictions, as seen in several U.S. states and countries like Uruguay and Argentina.\n\nThe new law is seen as a significant step towards correcting the historical criminalization of Jamaican citizens, particularly poor young black males, and addressing the victimization of Rastafarians. While the establishment of a cannabis licensing authority and the development of a medical marijuana sector will require further refinement, the amendments have been widely applauded as a progressive move.\n\nIn summary, Jamaica's decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana represents a major shift in its drug policy, balancing cultural acceptance and legal regulation while maintaining a strong stance against illegal activities. This change holds great potential for the country's economy and social justice, marking a new chapter in Jamaica's relationship with ganja.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

This ocean, which held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, was a mile deep in places and spread over a fifth of the planet's surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth. The evidence for this primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nScientists used three of the most powerful infrared telescopes in the world to study Mars and make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. Martian water, like that on Earth, contains standard water molecules and another form of water containing heavy hydrogen, known as deuterium. On Mars, the ordinary hydrogen in water is gradually leaking into outer space, leaving behind a higher concentration of deuterium. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water Mars has lost over time.\n\nThe infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet's frozen polar caps. The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. However, Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe huge body of water lasted for millions of years, but over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned, causing more ocean water to waft into space. The planet lost its insulation, and the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up in the Martian polar caps.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, the court found that Nestlé failed to demonstrate that the shape was recognized as distinctive in a sufficient number of EU countries, including Belgium, Ireland, Greece, and Portugal.\n\nThis ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) for reconsideration, but it does not necessarily mean the end of Nestlé's efforts. The company believes it can provide stronger evidence to support its claim. The decision has broader implications for trademark law within the EU, as it underscores the requirement for a product's distinctive character to be recognized across all member states, not just a significant part.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by trademark lawyers and has even entered the Brexit debate, with some suggesting that EU courts are not protecting British interests.

{"pred": " \n\nThe portrayal of dinosaur sounds in popular media, particularly the iconic roar of the Tyrannosaurus rex, has been a staple of cinematic history, from \"King Kong\" to \"Jurassic Park.\" However, recent research suggests that these depictions are far from accurate. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs likely did not roar as depicted in movies. Instead, their vocalizations might have been more akin to the coos and murmurs of modern birds. This conclusion is drawn from the study of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds, which produce low-frequency sounds through an esophageal pouch rather than an open beak.\n\nThe study, led by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, and other institutions, analyzed the vocal behaviors of living birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. They found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are used in territorial and mating displays, have evolved independently at least 16 times within the archosaur group, which includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. These vocalizations are typically produced by larger-bodied species, suggesting that large dinosaurs like the T. rex might have used similar methods to produce their calls.\n\nThe research also highlights the evolutionary link between birds and dinosaurs, noting that many dinosaurs likely had feathers and possibly used closed-mouth vocalizations during mating displays. This challenges the traditional image of dinosaurs as roaring beasts and instead paints a picture of creatures that communicated in ways more similar to birds than to mammals.\n\nIn addition to scientific insights, the study sheds light on the creative process behind the sounds in \"Jurassic Park.\" Sound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the film, used a variety of animal sounds to create the iconic dinosaur roars. For instance, the velociraptor's language was inspired by the calls of jackals, while the T. rex's roar was a blend of various animal sounds, including a baby elephant's cry. Despite the lack of scientific accuracy, these sounds have become iconic in their own right.\n\nOverall, the study not only provides a more accurate understanding of dinosaur vocalizations but also underscores the importance of interdisciplinary research in paleontology and evolutionary biology. By examining the vocal behaviors of living animals, scientists can make informed inferences about the sounds of extinct species, offering a glimpse into the ancient world that challenges long-held assumptions and enriches our understanding of the past.userHow do the vocalization methods of dinosaurs compare to those of modern birds and mammals, and what implications does this have for our understanding of dinosaur", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent breakthrough by researchers at UC Berkeley has brought us closer to the possibility of reading and reconstructing visual experiences directly from the brain. In a groundbreaking study, scientists have successfully pieced together YouTube videos from the brain activity of subjects who watched the same videos while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. This experiment marks a significant advancement in understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, as it is the first time a continuous, dynamic visual experience has been reconstructed from brain patterns.\n\nThe study involved subjects, including the researchers themselves, who spent hours inside an MRI machine watching sets of movie trailers. The MRI recorded the blood flow in the visual cortex, which processes visual information. This data was then used to develop a \"movie reconstruction algorithm\" that matched neural activity with the dynamic information in the videos, such as shapes, images, and sounds. The algorithm was trained on 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, allowing it to associate specific neural patterns with visual content.\n\nOnce the algorithm was developed, it was used to reconstruct videos based on the brain activity recorded during the second viewing of the trailers. The resulting videos were continuous but abstract, resembling a Surrealist painting with a dream-like quality. This continuous reconstruction of dynamic visual experiences is a significant leap from previous capabilities, which were limited to static images.\n\nThe implications of this research are profound. It opens the door to potentially seeing what is happening in the mind without external visual stimuli, such as dreams and thoughts. The technology could eventually be used to broadcast internal imagery, providing insights into dreams, memories, and even fantasies. This could have applications in helping paralyzed individuals control their environment by imagining movements or in communication for those with paralyzing conditions.\n\nHowever, the technology is still in its early stages. The brain activity measured in this study represents only a fraction of the activity involved in seeing moving images. The brain consists of numerous modules, each responsible for different aspects of visual processing. Future research aims to build models for each part of the visual system, which would improve the resolution of reconstructed images and require significant computational power.\n\nWhile the potential applications are exciting, there are ethical and practical considerations. The use of this technology in legal contexts, such as detective work or court cases, raises questions about the reliability and interpretation of reconstructed memories. As the researchers themselves acknowledge, an accurate read-out of a faulty memory would only provide misleading information.\n\nIn summary, the UC Berkeley study represents a major step forward in understanding and reconstructing visual experiences from brain activity.

The scandal involves the creation of millions of bogus accounts without customers' knowledge, leading to a $185 million penalty for the bank and the firing of 5,300 employees. Warren accused Stumpf of failing to hold himself or any other senior executives accountable for the company's actions, calling it \"gutless leadership.\" She also criticized the bank's focus on cross-selling, which she argued was aimed at increasing the bank's stock price rather than deepening customer relationships. Stumpf defended the bank's actions, stating that cross-selling was about building relationships and not fraud.

Bayesian inference allows for the updating of probabilities as new information becomes available, making it a flexible tool in complex search scenarios.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian methods helped locate the wreckage after it had been missing for two years. The approach involved creating a probability map based on various data points, including historical crash data and search results.

Bayesian techniques could help narrow down the search zones by continuously updating the probability map with new data, such as satellite communications and ocean current simulations. However, experts like Bradley Efron express skepticism about the applicability of Bayesian methods in this case due to the drastic changes in the search parameters.\n\nOverall, while Bayesian statistics offer a promising framework for managing uncertainty and refining search efforts, the unique challenges of MH370's disappearance may limit their effectiveness.

The Virtual Telescope Project, led by astrophysicist Gianluca Masi, will provide a live stream of the event, featuring stunning images captured by a team of international astrophotographers. The eclipse will begin at 11:48 a.m. EST and reach totality at 1:30 p.m. EST, lasting for 77 minutes. During this time, the moon will take on a reddish hue, often referred to as a \"blood moon,\" due to the Earth's atmosphere bending sunlight. The event will also be visible from Rome, where the Super Blue Moon will rise above the city's iconic landmarks. This celestial spectacle follows a series of three visible supermoons in a row, with the first appearing on December 3, 2017, and the second on New Year's Day 2018.
