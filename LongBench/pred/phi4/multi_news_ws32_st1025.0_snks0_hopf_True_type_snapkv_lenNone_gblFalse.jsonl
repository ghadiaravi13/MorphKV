Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, led the research. The team tested MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke and found that it became significantly more resistant to macrophages, a type of immune cell.

The findings suggest that cigarette smoke alters the bacteria's structure, making it more invasive and harder to kill.\n\nThe research also compared the effects of traditional cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA.

The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke was four times more resistant to macrophages than those not exposed. Additionally, the bacteria's increased resistance persisted even after exposure, suggesting a lasting impact.\n\nThe studies highlight the dual threat posed by cigarette smoke: it not only harms the smoker's respiratory and immune systems but also enhances the pathogenicity of harmful bacteria.

AFM primarily affects children and is characterized by sudden onset of limb weakness and paralysis.\n\nThe condition was first brought to national attention in 2014 when a cluster of cases was reported in Colorado, coinciding with a national outbreak of Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). Although the exact cause of AFM remains unknown, it is believed to be linked to viral infections, including EV-D68 and other enteroviruses. The CDC has been actively tracking and investigating AFM cases to better understand the disease and its potential causes.\n\nIn 2016, the CDC reported 50 confirmed cases of AFM across 25 states, with the majority of cases occurring in children under the age of 18. The symptoms of AFM typically appear suddenly, with patients experiencing weakness in one or more limbs, difficulty moving the eyes, drooping eyelids, facial droop, difficulty with swallowing or slurred speech, and in severe cases, respiratory failure.\n\nThe CDC has issued health alerts and guidance for healthcare providers to report suspected cases of AFM. They have also emphasized the importance of early detection and intervention to improve outcomes for affected individuals. While there is no specific treatment for AFM, supportive care and rehabilitation can help manage symptoms and improve recovery.\n\nThe rise in AFM cases has prompted increased research efforts to understand the disease better and develop potential treatments. The CDC continues to monitor the situation closely and provides updates and resources for healthcare professionals and the public.\n\nIn summary, AFM is a concerning and emerging health issue that primarily affects children, with symptoms resembling those of polio.

At Marden Henge, a site larger than Avebury and ten times the size of Stonehenge, archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic house dating back over 4,300 years. This discovery, led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, suggests that Marden Henge may have been a central hub during the Neolithic period, rivaling the significance of Stonehenge itself. The house, which will be open to the public during an open day as part of the national festival of archaeology, is remarkably well-preserved and features white chalk floors and white plaster walls. The site has also yielded various artifacts, including flint tools, Roman brooches, and beautifully worked flint arrowheads, indicating a rich history of occupation and use.\n\nIn addition to the Neolithic house, the excavation at Wilsford henge, another site in the Vale of Pewsey, has revealed a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton believed to be that of a child. Found in a foetal position and adorned with an amber necklace, the skeleton is described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by Dr. Leary. Scientific analysis of the remains is expected to provide insights into the child's gender, diet, and place of origin. This discovery is part of a three-year archaeological project aimed at understanding the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The project, a collaboration between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, has already uncovered numerous artifacts, including flint tools, Roman brooches, and pottery.\n\nThe findings from these excavations highlight the importance of the fertile valleys of Wiltshire, which have often been overlooked in favor of the more famous chalkland sites like Stonehenge and Avebury. Dr. Leary emphasizes that the rich archaeological record in these valleys is crucial for understanding the broader prehistoric landscape. The discoveries at Marden and Wilsford henges not only add to our knowledge of Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain but also underscore the need for continued archaeological exploration and preservation in the region. The ongoing work at these sites promises to reveal even more about the ancient people who once inhabited this area, offering a deeper understanding of their lives and cultures.", "answers": ["You think Stonehenge is impressive?

Strayed's story of self-discovery and redemption through hiking the PCT has inspired many to embark on their own journeys. However, this surge in interest has led to concerns about overcrowding and environmental impact on the trail.\n\nThe PCT, which stretches from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has seen a dramatic increase in the number of hikers, particularly since the release of \"Wild.\" The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has reported a significant rise in permit applications, with over 4,000 permits issued in 2016 alone. This influx of hikers has raised concerns about the trail's capacity and the potential for environmental degradation.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the impact on the trail's fragile ecosystems, particularly in the desert sections. The increased foot traffic can lead to soil erosion, vegetation damage, and the establishment of new campsites, which can disrupt local wildlife. Additionally, the higher number of hikers has led to more search and rescue operations, placing a strain on local resources.\n\nTo address these issues, the PCTA has implemented a permit system to regulate the number of hikers on the trail. Permits are issued on a first-come, first-served basis, with a daily limit of 50 hikers starting from the Mexican border. This system aims to disperse hikers more evenly along the trail and reduce the environmental impact.\n\nDespite these measures, some hikers and trail enthusiasts worry that the PCT may become too crowded, losing its sense of solitude and adventure. The trail's reputation as a place for self-discovery and personal growth is at risk if it becomes overrun with inexperienced hikers.\n\nIn conclusion, while the PCT continues to inspire and attract hikers from around the world, it is essential to balance this popularity with responsible trail management.

The fossil's preservation was so remarkable that it included traces of pigment in the feathers, providing insights into the dinosaur's original coloration.\n\nCaihong's iridescent feathers are similar to those of modern hummingbirds, suggesting that these dinosaurs may have used their colorful plumage for social signaling, such as attracting mates or establishing dominance. The discovery of Caihong adds to the growing body of evidence that many dinosaurs had feathers, which were likely used for a variety of functions beyond flight, including display and insulation.\n\nThe fossil also revealed that Caihong had a bird-like body structure, with asymmetrical feathers on its tail, indicating that it may have been capable of gliding or even powered flight.

Former Mayor Ed Murray championed the tax as a means to reduce sugar consumption, fund healthy food initiatives for low-income families, and generate revenue for the city. However, the tax has faced strong opposition, with critics arguing that it is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals, and failing to achieve its health objectives. \n\nThe tax, which increased the price of sugary beverages by nearly 20%, has led to unintended economic consequences. Retailers like Costco have reported a sharp decline in sales of sugary drinks within the city, as consumers choose to shop outside city limits to avoid the tax. This behavior mirrors the experience of Cook County, Illinois, where a similar tax led to a significant drop in local sales and a corresponding loss in expected revenue. \n\nCritics argue that the tax does not effectively promote healthier lifestyles but instead drives consumers to neighboring areas, thereby reducing local business revenue and potentially leading to job losses. The tax has also been criticized for its inconsistency, as it exempts certain beverages like diet sodas and coffee-based drinks, leading to accusations of unfairness and lack of clarity in its implementation. \n\nDespite the backlash, proponents of the tax maintain that it is a necessary step towards addressing public health issues related to sugar consumption. They argue that the tax serves as a deterrent to excessive sugar intake and can potentially lead to long-term health benefits. However, the immediate economic impact and public dissatisfaction suggest that the tax may need to be re-evaluated to balance health objectives with economic realities. \n\nIn summary, Seattle's soda tax has highlighted the complexities and challenges of using taxation as a tool for public health intervention.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear.

House Republicans, led by Speaker John Boehner, are pushing for a bill that includes provisions to delay the Affordable Care Act, while Senate Democrats, led by Majority Leader Harry Reid, are refusing to pass any bill that defunds or delays the healthcare law. The impasse has led to a weekend of negotiations, with both sides working through the night to avoid a shutdown that could begin as early as Monday night.\n\nThe potential shutdown has significant implications for the Washington, D.C. region, which is home to a large number of federal workers and contractors. Local economists estimate that the region could lose $200 million a day if the shutdown occurs, with over 700,000 jobs potentially affected. The impact would be felt across various sectors, including tourism, as federally funded museums and attractions would close. Additionally, local governments are bracing for a loss in income tax revenue from furloughed federal employees.\n\nThe political battle over the shutdown is intense, with both parties blaming each other for the impasse. Republicans argue that the Affordable Care Act is flawed and needs to be reformed, while Democrats maintain that the healthcare law is working and should not be used as a bargaining chip. The standoff has also raised concerns about the impact on essential services, with some local governments declaring all employees essential to avoid disruptions in services such as trash collection and libraries.\n\nAs the deadline approaches, there is still no clear resolution in sight.

This policy allows new parents to take off as much time as they want during the first year after a child’s birth or adoption. The company aims to foster a “freedom and responsibility” culture, giving employees the flexibility to balance their family needs without worrying about work or finances. Parents can return part-time, full-time, or take additional time off as needed, with the company continuing to pay them normally, eliminating the need to switch to state or disability pay. This policy is designed to support employees during significant life changes and help them return to work more focused and dedicated. Netflix’s Chief Talent Officer, Tawni Cranz, emphasized that the company’s success depends on attracting and retaining top talent, and that people perform better at work when they are not preoccupied with home concerns. The new policy, combined with Netflix’s existing unlimited time-off policy, underscores the company’s commitment to supporting its employees and maintaining a competitive edge in the talent market. This move is seen as a landmark perk, reflecting a shift in workplace culture towards better work-life balance, a trend also observed in companies like Yahoo, Facebook, and Google.

Brown's work has led to the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006, a decision that sparked widespread debate and controversy. Despite the backlash, Brown stands by his role in the reclassification, arguing that it was necessary for a more accurate understanding of our solar system.\n\nRecently, Brown and his team have presented evidence for the existence of a ninth planet, tentatively named \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet X.\" This planet is believed to be located in the outer reaches of our solar system, far beyond Pluto. The evidence for Planet Nine is based on the unusual orbits of several distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, a region of the solar system beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies.\n\nBrown's discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt, was a key factor in the decision to reclassify Pluto. Eris is similar in size to Pluto, but its discovery challenged the notion that Pluto was unique in its size and location. This led to the International Astronomical Union's decision to redefine the term \"planet,\" resulting in Pluto's demotion to dwarf planet status.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding his work, Brown remains committed to exploring the mysteries of our solar system.

CAD is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become damaged or diseased, often due to plaque buildup and inflammation. This can lead to serious health issues such as heart attacks and strokes.\n\nA significant study, sponsored by Pfizer and published in The New England Journal of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over five years. The research, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore from NYU Langone Medical Center, found that those who experienced large fluctuations in body weight had a substantially higher risk of adverse health outcomes. Specifically, individuals in the top fifth for weight variability had a 117% increased risk of death, a 124% increased risk of stroke, a 117% increased risk of heart attack, and a 78% increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes compared to those with the least weight variability.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has linked yo-yo dieting, also known as weight cycling, to poor heart health. Dr. Bangalore's team observed that the median weight fluctuation among participants was 8.7 pounds per visit, with the most significant weight changes linked to a 124% increase in mortality.\n\nWhile the study is observational and cannot establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship, it raises concerns about the impact of weight fluctuation in people with CAD. The researchers suggest that maintaining a stable weight is crucial for individuals with CAD and that further investigation is needed to understand how to help people keep their weight stable.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic emphasizes the importance of a healthy lifestyle in preventing and treating CAD, which includes managing weight effectively. The new findings underscore the need for individuals, especially those with pre-existing heart conditions, to avoid yo-yo dieting and instead focus on sustainable weight management strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, the research indicates that for people with coronary artery disease, maintaining a consistent weight is vital to reducing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious health complications. The study calls for more research into the mechanisms behind the increased risks associated with weight cycling and strategies to help individuals maintain a stable weight.\n", "answers": ["Losing weight is one thing, keeping it off quite another.

The problem, which involves a malfunctioning ammonia coolant, was discovered on Wednesday when one of the station's external cooling loops was shut down due to a temperature issue. Although the situation is not life-threatening, it has necessitated a reduction in normal operations, with some non-essential systems being turned off in various modules of the station.\n\nNASA and its partners have identified this issue as one of the \"Big 14\" maintenance challenges they expect to encounter during the ISS's operation. The current crew, consisting of two Americans, three Russians, and a Japanese astronaut, has been prioritizing essential systems and experiments while engineers work on diagnosing and resolving the problem. The malfunctioning cooling loop is suspected to be caused by a problem with the ammonia coolant, and teams are assessing whether a spacewalk will be necessary to fix it.\n\nThis is not the first time the ISS has faced cooling system issues. In the past, similar problems have been addressed through spacewalks, with the most recent one occurring in May. The current situation is being closely monitored, and NASA has not ruled out the possibility of a spacewalk if needed. However, the decision will depend on the results of ongoing assessments and the availability of resources.\n\nThe ISS has been continuously occupied since 2000, with crews typically spending four to six months on the station.

Despite the accuracy of his predictions, Ricks expressed a preference for being wrong, as he would have rather underestimated the storm's impact than face the reality of the devastation. His personal plea during the storm earned him hero status, and his document's accuracy highlighted the importance of clear and effective communication during weather emergencies.

Recent studies, including one led by Dr. Samantha Hendren at the University of Michigan, reveal that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50. This finding challenges the current guidelines that recommend screening starting at age 50 and suggests a need for reevaluation.\n\nThe University of Michigan study analyzed data from over 258,000 colorectal cancer patients and found significant changes in age demographics. Younger patients often present with advanced stages of cancer, including metastasis, which raises concerns about the effectiveness of current screening practices. Despite the advanced stage at diagnosis, younger patients tend to have better survival rates compared to older patients, possibly due to more aggressive treatment approaches.\n\nSymptoms of colorectal cancer, such as bleeding and changes in bowel habits, are often overlooked in younger individuals, leading to delayed diagnosis.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological discovery at a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges of southern Australia has unveiled evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years, making it one of the oldest known sites of human habitation in the arid interior of the continent. The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, was discovered by chance when archaeologist Giles Hamm and his team were surveying the area. The discovery includes sophisticated tools, ochre, and bone tools, indicating a complex and technologically advanced society.\n\nThe excavation methods employed at the site were meticulous, involving careful stratigraphic analysis and the use of advanced dating techniques such as optical dating and thermoluminescence. These methods have allowed scientists to accurately date the artifacts and establish a timeline of human activity at the site. The findings suggest that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia much earlier than previously thought, challenging existing theories about the migration and settlement patterns of early Australians.\n\nThe discovery also provides new insights into the interactions between early humans and megafauna, as well as the use of ochre and other pigments, which were likely used for symbolic or ritualistic purposes. The presence of sophisticated tools and evidence of hunting and gathering practices indicate a high level of adaptability and innovation among the early inhabitants of the region.\n\nOverall, the Warratyi rock shelter discovery is a significant milestone in our understanding of human prehistory in Australia. It highlights the ingenuity and resilience of early Australians and provides valuable insights into their way of life, culture, and interactions with the environment.

The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

Kardashev's model outlines three types of civilizations: Type I, which harnesses all of a planet's resources; Type II, which captures all the energy of a star; and Type III, which utilizes the energy of an entire galaxy. Recent studies, including one by Dan Hooper, suggest that as the universe expands, civilizations must capture energy from stars before they become inaccessible due to cosmic expansion. Hooper's paper, posted on arXiv.org, posits that advanced civilizations would create structures like Dyson spheres to capture stellar energy. These structures, first described by Olaf Stapledon in 1937 and later by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, involve surrounding a star with a spherical shell to harness its energy. The concept has been popularized in science fiction, with examples like Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" While humans are currently at a Type I civilization level, some scientists speculate that older alien civilizations may already be at Type III, harvesting energy from entire galaxies. Detecting such civilizations could involve observing unusual light signatures from galaxies, indicating the presence of Dyson spheres or similar mega-structures.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological findings in East Africa, particularly in the Olorgesailie Basin of Kenya, have significantly altered our understanding of early human behavior and technological advancements. These discoveries, reported in three papers published in Science, suggest that dramatic shifts in climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven early Homo sapiens to develop advanced tool-making techniques and long-distance trade networks. This period marks a significant transition from the Acheulean hand axes to more sophisticated Middle Stone Age tools, indicating a response to environmental pressures and a need for greater mobility and innovation.\n\nThe findings challenge the previously held belief that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and complex social networks, emerged only around 40,000-50,000 years ago during a so-called \"human revolution.\" Instead, evidence from the Olorgesailie Basin shows that these behaviors were present much earlier, around 320,000 years ago, and were likely driven by long-term global environmental changes. This suggests that early Homo sapiens were capable of significant cultural and technological adaptations well before the migration out of Africa.\n\nThe research highlights the importance of climate change as a catalyst for human evolution, pushing early populations to adapt through technological innovation and expanded social networks. The use of obsidian for tool-making and the evidence of long-distance trade networks indicate a level of sophistication in early human societies that was previously underestimated. These findings also suggest that the development of modern human behaviors was a gradual process, influenced by environmental pressures and the need for survival, rather than a sudden revolution.\n\nOverall, the discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin provide crucial insights into the early development of Homo sapiens, challenging Eurocentric views of human evolution and highlighting the complexity and depth of the African archaeological record. They underscore the role of climate change in driving human innovation and adaptation, offering a more nuanced understanding of our evolutionary history.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

He emphasized self-defense and mental health as key issues, arguing that \"sick people\" are the root cause of such incidents, not guns. Trump's comments marked his most extensive remarks on firearms since launching his campaign.\n\nTrump's position on gun control has evolved over the years. While he now strongly supports Second Amendment rights, he has previously backed stricter gun regulations.

His parents, Aimee and Todd Hardy, launched a public campaign to secure the drug, which was initially denied by Chimerix due to its experimental status and the company's focus on completing clinical trials.\n\nThe Hardys' story gained national attention, with media outlets like CNN covering their plight. The public campaign, which included social media efforts and the creation of a Facebook page called \"Save Josh,\" garnered widespread support. The hashtag #savejosh and the Facebook page \"Josh's Army\" played significant roles in rallying public support.\n\nChimerix, in collaboration with the FDA, eventually agreed to provide the drug to Josh under a compassionate use arrangement, making him the first patient in a new clinical trial. The company's president, Kenneth Moch, expressed hope that the trial would benefit not only Josh but also other patients in need.

Despite the acquittal, Simpson was later convicted of unrelated crimes in Nevada and has been serving a prison sentence since 2008.\n\nSimpson's financial situation has significantly deteriorated since his heyday. Once estimated to have a net worth of $250 million in the mid-1990s, his assets have dwindled due to legal fees, judgments, and other financial obligations. He reportedly has a current net worth of around $250,000. His financial decline began after the infamous 1995 trial, which led to a civil lawsuit where he was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the victims' families. His financial troubles continued with the loss of his primary residence and other assets.\n\nSimpson's career was illustrious before his legal troubles. He was a celebrated NFL player, known for his time with the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers, and later became a successful actor and sports commentator. His legacy in sports is cemented by his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe upcoming parole hearing has garnered significant media attention, reflecting the enduring public fascination with Simpson's case.

{"pred": " \n\nJamaica has made a historic move by decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana, known locally as ganja. This legislative change, which has been in the works for decades, marks a significant shift in the country's drug policy. The new law, passed by Jamaican lawmakers, reduces possession of small quantities to a petty offense and paves the way for the establishment of a medical cannabis industry. \n\nUnder the new legislation, possession of up to 2 ounces (56.7 grams) of marijuana will no longer result in a criminal record. Additionally, the cultivation of up to five plants is permitted for personal use. This change is particularly significant for Rastafarians, who can now legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time. The law also allows tourists prescribed medical marijuana to use it legally in Jamaica.\n\nThe legislation establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This move is expected to boost Jamaica's nascent medical marijuana industry and create new economic opportunities. Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton has expressed optimism about the potential for the industry to contribute to the country's economy, especially given Jamaica's current loan program with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nDespite these changes, the Jamaican government remains firm on its stance against transnational drug trafficking and illegal cultivation. National Security Minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the new law does not equate to a free-for-all in drug production and trafficking. The government will continue to uphold its international treaty obligations and combat drug trafficking rigorously.\n\nThe decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is part of a broader international trend towards easing restrictions on the drug. In the Americas, countries like Uruguay have legalized marijuana, and several U.S. states have also moved towards legalization. This shift reflects changing attitudes towards marijuana and its potential medical benefits.\n\nThe new law is seen as a victory for religious freedom and social justice, particularly for Rastafarians and young Jamaicans who have been disproportionately affected by previous drug laws. The legislation is expected to reduce the number of young people with criminal records and alleviate some of the social and economic burdens associated with drug-related offenses.\n\nIn summary, Jamaica's decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana represents a significant step towards modernizing its drug laws, promoting medical research, and fostering economic growth. While the government remains committed to combating drug trafficking, the new legislation is a progressive move that aligns with global trends and addresses long-standing social issues within the country.", "answers": ["Alaska yesterday became the third state to legalize marijuana for recreational use, and now a country where you would have thought that was the case already is moving closer to that goal itself.

This revelation, brought to light by NASA scientists, paints a picture of early Mars as a warm and wet world, potentially hospitable to alien life", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Nestlé had spent over a decade fighting to protect the distinctive shape of its KitKat bars, arguing that the four-fingered design was uniquely associated with its brand. However, the court found that Nestlé had not provided sufficient evidence to show that consumers across the European Union recognized the shape as distinctive to KitKat.\n\nThe ruling was a victory for Mondelez, the American company that owns Cadbury and had opposed Nestlé's trademark application. Mondelez argued that the shape of the KitKat was not distinctive enough to warrant trademark protection and that allowing such a trademark would stifle competition and innovation in the confectionery market. The court's decision means that other companies could potentially produce similar four-fingered chocolate bars without infringing on Nestlé's trademark.\n\nThis case has broader implications for trademark law in the EU, particularly concerning the protection of product shapes. Trademark law in the EU requires that a shape must have acquired distinctiveness through use to be protected. The court's ruling suggests that Nestlé failed to demonstrate that the KitKat shape had acquired such distinctiveness across all EU member states.\n\nThe decision also highlights the challenges companies face in protecting product designs in a single market with diverse consumer perceptions. While the KitKat shape is well-known in some countries, it did not achieve the same level of recognition in others, which was a key factor in the court's ruling.\n\nIn addition to the implications for Nestlé and Mondelez, the ruling could affect other companies with similar disputes over product shapes. For example, Mondelez owns the Toblerone brand, which has successfully trademarked its distinctive triangular shape. The contrasting outcomes of these cases underscore the complexities of trademark law and the importance of demonstrating distinctiveness across the entire EU market.\n\nThe ruling has also been noted in the context of Brexit, with some commentators suggesting that it highlights the challenges of navigating EU regulations for British companies. The case has been used by some Brexit supporters to argue for the benefits of leaving the EU, suggesting that EU regulations can be overly restrictive and detrimental to British businesses.\n\nOverall, the European Court of Justice's decision against Nestlé's trademark application for the KitKat shape is a significant ruling with wide-ranging implications for trademark law and the confectionery industry in the EU.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent research on dinosaur vocalizations has revealed that the iconic roaring sounds depicted in movies are likely inaccurate. Instead, dinosaurs may have produced sounds more akin to the cooing of birds, with some possibly using closed-mouth vocalizations. This new understanding comes from a study published in the journal Evolution, which examined the vocal behaviors of modern birds and their evolutionary relatives, the archosaurs, which include both birds and crocodiles.\n\nThe study, funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, aimed to understand the evolution of the unique vocal organ of birds and the diverse sounds they can produce. Researchers analyzed the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization among birds and other reptilian groups, finding that this behavior is not ancestral but has evolved independently multiple times within the archosaur lineage.\n\nClosed-mouth vocalizations are produced with the beak closed and are typically lower in frequency than open-mouth sounds. They are often used in territorial or courtship displays. The study found that large-bodied birds, such as pigeons and doves, are more likely to use this vocalization method. Given that many non-avian dinosaurs were large-bodied, it is suggested that they too may have used closed-mouth vocalizations, particularly during mating displays.\n\nThe research also highlights that while birds today do not have vocal cords like mammals, they possess a syrinx, a specialized vocal organ that allows for a wide range of sounds. The presence of feathers in some dinosaurs, as evidenced by fossil records, supports the idea that they could have had similar vocal structures.\n\nIn conclusion, the study challenges the traditional portrayal of dinosaurs as roaring beasts and instead paints a picture of creatures that may have communicated with soft, bird-like coos and calls. This research not only reshapes our understanding of dinosaur behavior but also provides insights into the evolutionary history of vocalization in archosaurs.

In 2005, Vanderbilt began referring to the building as \"Memorial Hall,\" but a legal agreement with the United Daughters of the Confederate required the university to repay an 83-year-old donation to officially change the name.

Despite extensive search efforts, the plane's location remains unknown. Bayesian statistical methods, which have been successfully employed in past search operations, such as locating the missing Air France Flight 447, are being considered for the MH370 search. These methods involve creating probability maps based on available data, which can help refine search areas.\n\nBayesian inference, named after 18th-century Presbyterian minister Thomas Bayes, allows for the updating of probability estimates as new information becomes available. This approach was instrumental in locating the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in 2009. The search for the plane involved analyzing various theories about its crash location and updating the probability maps accordingly. Despite initial challenges, the Bayesian approach eventually led to the successful discovery of the wreckage.\n\nIn the case of MH370, the search is complicated by conflicting theories about the plane's final location. Some evidence suggests it may have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, while other data points to a possible crash site in the Bay of Bengal. Bayesian methods can help reconcile these conflicting theories by assigning probabilities to each scenario and updating them as new evidence emerges.\n\nHowever, experts like Colleen Keller, who played a key role in the Air France search, express skepticism about the likelihood of finding MH370. The vastness of the search area and the passage of time since the plane's disappearance make it increasingly unlikely that the wreckage will be located. Despite this, Bayesian methods continue to offer a structured approach to narrowing down the search area and providing hope that the mystery may eventually be solved.\n\nIn summary, while Bayesian statistical methods offer a promising tool for the search for MH370, the challenges posed by the vast search area and conflicting evidence make the task daunting. The disappearance of MH370 remains an unsolved mystery, but the application of Bayesian inference provides a systematic way to approach the search and potentially uncover new leads.", "answers": ["Forget satellite images and aerial searches—the best way to find Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 may be with mathematical techniques dating back to the 18th century, the BBC reports.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The supermoon refers to a full moon that appears larger and brighter in the sky because it is closer to Earth in its orbit. The blue moon is the second full moon in a calendar month, making it a rare occurrence. During the eclipse, the moon will take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"blood moon.\"\n\nThe eclipse will be visible from various parts of the world, including eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, and parts of the western Atlantic. In the United States, the eclipse will be visible in its entirety from the Pacific coast and in a partial phase from the eastern coast. The event will begin at 11:48 a.m. UTC and reach totality at 1:12 p.m. UTC, lasting for about 72 minutes.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project will provide live streams of the eclipse, allowing people worldwide to witness the event from the comfort of their homes. The project will partner with several astro-photographers from Australia and the United States to capture stunning images of the eclipse.\n\nThe supermoon phenomenon is not uncommon, but having three visible supermoons in a row, as experienced in the winter of 2017-2018, is rare. The first supermoon of the series appeared on December 3, 2017, followed by the second on December 13, and the third on January 1, 2018. The final supermoon of the series will coincide with the total lunar eclipse on January 31, 2018.\n\nTo view the supermoon and lunar eclipse, it is best to look at the moon shortly after moonrise and before sunrise, when it appears largest and brightest due to the \"moon illusion\" effect. The moon will appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a typical full moon. If the weather or other circumstances prevent outdoor viewing, the event can be watched via live streams provided by organizations like the Virtual Telescope Project.\n\nPhotographing the supermoon or lunar eclipse can be done with a smartphone or DSLR camera.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
