The studies, led by Dr. Laura E.

The results showed that the smoke-exposed MRSA was significantly more resistant to the immune system's defenses, particularly the macrophages, which are cells that engulf and destroy bacteria. The smoke-exposed MRSA was also found to be more aggressive, causing higher mortality rates in mice.\n\nThe studies also found that cigarette smoke alters the structure of MRSA, making it more resistant to antibiotics.

By employing methods akin to Google's PageRank algorithm, the team sought to determine which individuals hold the most significant articles linking to them across Wikipedia's vast repository of knowledge. Surprisingly, Frank Sinatra emerged as the most important figure in the English-language edition of Wikipedia, with Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII following closely behind. However, when the analysis was expanded to include all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, Adolf Hitler was deemed the most important, with Michael Jackson and Madonna in second and third places, respectively.\n\nThe study's primary aim was not to crown the most important person but to investigate potential biases in Wikipedia's coverage, such as skewness by gender, location, or time period. The findings revealed a Western and male-dominated representation of historical figures across Wikipedia's language editions. To address the peculiarities of Wikipedia's structure, the researchers introduced CheiRank, a complementary measure to PageRank, which considers the number of outgoing links from an article. By combining PageRank and CheiRank into a two-dimensional ranking system called 2DRank, the researchers were able to mitigate the anomalies caused by Wikipedia's unique linking patterns.\n\nIn a separate but related study, Eom's team explored the concept of intellectual influence by analyzing the web of links within Wikipedia. They aimed to identify the most influential thinker by tracing the path of connections leading to various individuals. Carl Linnaeus, the Swedish naturalist known for his work in taxonomy, was identified as the most influential mind, surpassing figures such as Isaac Newton, Jesus, and even historical leaders like Adolf Hitler. This result was attributed to the extensive use of Linnaeus' binomial nomenclature across scientific Wikipedia pages, which consistently linked back to him.\n\nThese studies highlight the complexities of measuring influence and importance in the digital age, where algorithms and online platforms can significantly shape our understanding of historical and contemporary figures. They also underscore the need for a nuanced approach to analyzing data, as different methodologies can yield vastly different outcomes. As we continue to navigate the ever-expanding digital landscape, such research provides valuable insights into the interplay between technology, information, and human perception.", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person.

The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events.

Recently, a forensic investigation has cast doubt on its authenticity, suggesting that it may be a medieval forgery. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, involved a detailed analysis of the bloodstain patterns on the shroud, which is believed by some to bear the image of Jesus Christ.\n\nResearchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli conducted experiments using both real and synthetic blood to replicate the bloodstain patterns found on the shroud. They used a live model and a mannequin to simulate the wounds depicted on the shroud, such as those from scourging and a spear wound. Their findings indicated that the bloodstain patterns on the shroud could not have been produced by the wounds as they are represented. For instance, the angle and flow of the bloodstains suggested that the body was in a different position than what would be expected if the shroud were a genuine burial cloth.\n\nThe study also highlighted inconsistencies in the depiction of the wounds themselves. The bloodstain patterns did not match the expected results from the types of wounds shown, such as the spear wound to the chest, which would have caused blood to flow in a manner inconsistent with the patterns on the shroud. Additionally, the researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud were inconsistent with the idea that the body was laid out in a supine position, as would be expected in a burial.\n\nThe implications of this research are significant, as they challenge the long-held belief that the Shroud of Turin is the authentic burial cloth of Jesus. While the shroud has been venerated by many as a holy relic, the forensic analysis suggests that it may have been created as a medieval artwork, possibly as a teaching tool or a devotional object.

Led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, the digs at Marden Henge and Wilsford Henge have revealed a wealth of artifacts and structures that date back over 4,000 years.\n\nAt Marden Henge, one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the UK, the team discovered a well-preserved Neolithic house. This rectangular structure, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period, was found alongside flint tools, beautifully crafted flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and even a Roman brooch. The house, which is thought to have been used for gatherings rather than permanent habitation, suggests that Marden Henge was a site of significant social and ceremonial importance. The discovery of pig bones and other evidence of feasting indicates that the site hosted large gatherings, possibly to display wealth and power.\n\nIn addition to the house, the excavation at Marden Henge has uncovered a previously unknown Roman complex, including a barn, which highlights the site's long history of occupation and use. The sheer scale of Marden Henge, with its vast enclosure, suggests it was a monumental project that required considerable resources and labor, underscoring its importance in the Neolithic landscape.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, another significant discovery was made: a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child. Found wearing amber beads, the skeleton is currently undergoing scientific analysis to determine its gender, diet, and possible origins. This find adds a personal dimension to the archaeological narrative, providing insights into the lives of individuals who lived in the area during the Bronze Age.\n\nThe ongoing excavations, part of a three-year project funded by Historic England, aim to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric landscape around Stonehenge. The discoveries at Marden and Wilsford henges not only highlight the complexity and richness of this ancient landscape but also emphasize the need for further research and protection of these invaluable sites. The findings will be displayed to the public during the national festival of archaeology, offering a rare glimpse into the lives of our ancestors and the monumental achievements of prehistoric societies.", "answers": ["You think Stonehenge is impressive?

The dinosaur's name, Caihong, translates to \"rainbow\" in Mandarin, reflecting its vibrant plumage.\n\nThe fossil was unearthed in the Liaoning Province, a region renowned for its exceptional preservation of feathered dinosaurs. The discovery was made by a local farmer and later acquired by the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning. Researchers from the University of Texas at Austin and the Chinese Academy of Sciences have been studying the specimen, revealing that Caihong's feathers were not only colorful but also structured in a way that suggests they could have been used for display purposes, possibly for attracting mates or intimidating rivals.\n\nCaihong's feathers exhibit a unique combination of iridescence and asymmetry, characteristics typically associated with flight feathers in modern birds. This suggests that while Caihong may not have been capable of powered flight, it could have glided or parachuted from trees, similar to some modern-day birds. The presence of asymmetrical feathers indicates that Caihong was part of a lineage that was experimenting with flight adaptations.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong adds significant insight into the evolution of feathers and flight in dinosaurs. It supports the hypothesis that feathers initially evolved for purposes other than flight, such as display or thermoregulation, and only later became adapted for aerial locomotion.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Previously considered one of the safest pain relievers for pregnant women, new research suggests that frequent use of acetaminophen may be linked to an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children.\n\nThe studies, one of which was conducted by Dr. Beate Ritz and her team at UCLA, analyzed data from over 64,000 children and found that children whose mothers frequently used acetaminophen during pregnancy were more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD. However, the researchers emphasized that this does not mean pregnant women should completely avoid the drug. Instead, they recommend avoiding chronic use until more research is conducted.\n\nThe study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from the Danish National Birth Cohort, which included over 64,000 children born between 1996 and 2002.

The risk increased to 37% for children whose mothers used the drug for more than 28 days during pregnancy.\n\nThe researchers also found that the risk of ADHD was higher for children whose mothers used acetaminophen during the third trimester of pregnancy. However, the study did not find a link between acetaminophen use and other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism or learning disabilities.\n\nThe study’s findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and neurodevelopmental disorders in children.

ACOG recommends that pregnant women use acetaminophen only when necessary and at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.\n\nThe study’s authors also caution that pregnant women should not stop taking acetaminophen without consulting their healthcare provider, as the drug is often necessary for managing pain and fever during pregnancy.

There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Tawni Cranz, Netflix’s Chief Talent Officer, emphasized that the company’s success depends on attracting and retaining top talent, and that people perform better at work when they are not stressed about home life. The new policy, combined with Netflix’s existing unlimited time-off policy, aims to support employees during significant life changes and help them return to work more focused and dedicated. This move is seen as a landmark perk, demonstrating Netflix’s commitment to current and potential employees. The policy also extends leave to fathers, recognizing the challenges of the entire first year after childbirth. However, it is noted that unlimited time-off policies can have pitfalls, requiring employees to coordinate with managers and teams to ensure their absence does not impact projects or deadlines. This policy aligns with trends in the tech industry, where companies like Yahoo have also enhanced their maternity and paternity leave to remain competitive. Overall, Netflix’s new policy reflects a shift towards prioritizing work-life balance and supporting employees’ personal lives, which is increasingly important for attracting and retaining top talent in the industry.", "answers": ["Expecting parents wondering which company offers the best maternity and paternity leave in the US need look no further.

Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, played a key role in the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006. This decision was based on the discovery of Eris, a similar-sized object in the Kuiper Belt, which led to the realization that Pluto was not unique in its category.\n\nBrown's work did not stop there. He, along with his colleague Konstantin Batygin, has recently provided compelling evidence for the existence of a ninth planet in our solar system, tentatively named Planet Nine. This planet is believed to be about ten times the mass of Earth and orbits far beyond Neptune. The evidence for Planet Nine includes the unusual orbits of several distant objects in the Kuiper Belt, which suggest they are being influenced by a massive, unseen planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has reignited interest in the outer reaches of our solar system and has significant implications for our understanding of planetary formation and dynamics. Brown's work continues to challenge and expand our knowledge of the solar system, proving that there is still much to learn about our cosmic neighborhood.\n\nIn addition to his scientific contributions, Brown has become a prominent figure in popularizing astronomy.

CAD is a condition where the coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, become damaged due to plaque buildup, leading to a reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. This can result in chest pain, heart attacks, and other serious complications.\n\nThe studies, including one led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore and published in The New England Journal of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over five years. The research found that those with the highest variability in body weight had a significantly increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Specifically, individuals with the greatest weight fluctuations were 78% more likely to develop diabetes, 59% more likely to have a heart attack, 59% more likely to suffer a stroke, and 117% more likely to die compared to those with the least weight variability.\n\nThe findings suggest that weight cycling, or the repeated loss and gain of weight, may be particularly harmful for those with pre-existing heart conditions. The exact mechanisms behind these increased risks are not fully understood, but the studies indicate that maintaining a stable weight is crucial for individuals with CAD.\n\nThe research underscores the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle to prevent and manage CAD.

Recent studies, including one led by Dr. Samantha Hendren at the University of Michigan, reveal that one in seven colorectal cancer patients is younger than 50. This shift challenges current screening guidelines, which recommend starting screenings at age 50.\n\nThe University of Michigan study analyzed data from nearly 260,000 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2016. It found that younger patients often present with more advanced stages of cancer, likely due to the lack of early screening. Despite this, younger patients tend to respond better to aggressive treatments, resulting in survival rates comparable to older patients.\n\nDr. Hendren emphasizes the need for heightened awareness and possibly revised screening guidelines to address this trend. The study also highlights the importance of recognizing symptoms such as unexplained bleeding, changes in bowel habits, and persistent abdominal discomfort, which can be early indicators of colorectal cancer.\n\nEnvironmental factors, including diet, obesity, and physical inactivity, are suspected contributors to the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger populations. Dr. Andrew Chan from Harvard Medical School notes that while the exact reasons for this increase are unclear, lifestyle changes may play a significant role.\n\nThe findings suggest a potential need for earlier screening in high-risk individuals, such as those with a family history of colorectal cancer. However, experts like Dr. Chan caution against broad changes to screening guidelines without further evidence, given the low overall risk in younger populations.\n\nIn conclusion, the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in individuals under 50 calls for a reevaluation of current screening practices and greater awareness of the disease's symptoms and risk factors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

The EPA's investigation was prompted by footage from the show, which depicted renovations at 33 properties in Waco, Texas, where Magnolia Homes failed to comply with the EPA's Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) Rule. This rule mandates that firms performing renovation, repair, and painting projects that disturb lead-based paint in homes, child care facilities, and schools built before 1978 must be certified and follow specific work practices to prevent lead contamination.\n\nUnder the terms of the settlement, Magnolia Homes will pay a civil penalty of $40,000 and undertake several corrective actions. These include producing an educational video on lead safety, to be released within 90 days, and spending $160,000 on a supplemental environmental project aimed at reducing lead hazards in the Waco community. Additionally, Magnolia Homes has agreed to implement a comprehensive compliance management plan to ensure adherence to lead safety regulations in future projects.\n\nThe EPA's enforcement action highlights the importance of compliance with lead safety regulations to protect public health, particularly the health of children who are most vulnerable to lead poisoning. Lead exposure can cause serious health issues, including developmental delays and neurological damage. The settlement serves as a reminder to renovation firms of the critical need to follow lead safety protocols and the potential consequences of non-compliance.\n\nThis case also underscores the role of media in bringing regulatory issues to light.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

They say the day after a Born Killers scene in which the girl sat on Sizemore's lap, she told her parents that he had touched her inappropriately, possibly putting his finger inside her. \"At one point her eyes got just huge, like she could've vomited.

Initially, Linda loathed Cruz due to his violent and disruptive behavior in the classroom. However, over time, she developed a deep bond with him, eventually adopting him and changing his life forever.\n\nCruz was born into a tumultuous household, where he was subjected to physical and emotional abuse by his father. His mother, unable to protect him, left him in the care of his grandparents. Cruz's grandparents, however, were unable to provide him with the love and support he needed, leading him to act out in school.\n\nLinda first encountered Cruz in her sixth-grade classroom, where he was known for his violent outbursts and disruptive behavior. Despite her initial dislike for him, Linda saw potential in Cruz and decided to take him under her wing. She began to mentor him, teaching him how to control his anger and channel his energy into more productive activities.\n\nAs Cruz grew older, he began to open up to Linda, sharing his traumatic past and the abuse he had suffered at the hands of his father. Linda, moved by his story, decided to adopt him, providing him with the love and support he had been missing for so long.\n\nUnder Linda's care, Cruz blossomed into a responsible and caring young man.

Despite being able to hear with the aid of a hearing device, Kieran faced social challenges due to his appearance, which led to his longing for ear reconstruction surgery.\n\nThe six-hour procedure, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved harvesting rib cartilage to craft the framework for Kieran's new ears. The surgical team used an outline of Kieran's mother's ears as a template to ensure symmetry and a natural look. The new ears were then grafted onto Kieran's head, with the expectation that they would last a lifetime, unlike prosthetic alternatives.\n\nKieran's surgery is not only a cosmetic enhancement but also a significant psychological boost. The operation is expected to improve his self-esteem and social interactions, as he expressed a desire to look like his peers and engage in activities such as wearing sunglasses and earphones without feeling self-conscious. His parents, particularly his mother Louise Sorkin, have been supportive of his decision, emphasizing the importance of his happiness and acceptance among his peers.\n\nThe hospital spokeswoman mentioned ongoing research into less invasive methods of ear reconstruction, such as growing new ear frameworks from stem cells, which could revolutionize the treatment for children like Kieran in the future.\n\nKieran's story has been widely covered in the media, with updates on his recovery and the positive impact the surgery has had on his life.

This change is particularly impactful for young people and marginalized communities who have historically been disproportionately affected by strict drug laws.\n\nThe legislation also establishes a framework for the development of a medical cannabis industry, allowing for the cultivation and regulation of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This includes the establishment of a licensing agency to oversee the industry. Additionally, the law permits the cultivation of up to five plants per household, reflecting a significant shift towards more lenient cannabis policies.\n\nReligious freedom is another key aspect of the new legislation. Rastafarians, for whom marijuana holds significant religious importance, can now legally use ganja for religious purposes. This change is a long-awaited victory for the Rastafarian community, which has faced legal challenges for decades.\n\nTourism is also set to benefit from the new law.

The evidence suggests that early Mars had a global ocean, with a depth of about 100 meters, and that the planet was habitable for a much longer period than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean was made possible by the use of powerful telescopes and infrared spectroscopy, which allowed scientists to measure the amount of water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and determine its isotopic composition.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water.

{"pred": " \n\nThe portrayal of dinosaurs in popular media, particularly in movies like Jurassic Park, has often depicted them as roaring creatures. However, recent research suggests that this depiction is inaccurate. Studies indicate that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, likely did not roar but instead made sounds more akin to the cooing or murmuring of birds. This conclusion is drawn from the understanding that many dinosaurs, like birds, were descendants of a common ancestor and shared similar anatomical features, including the presence of feathers and possibly air sacs used for vocalization.\n\nThe research, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocal behaviors of modern birds and crocodilians, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. It found that large-bodied birds and crocodilians often use closed-mouth vocalizations, which produce lower-pitched sounds. These findings suggest that large dinosaurs might have used similar vocalizations, especially during mating displays or territorial calls.\n\nThe study also highlights the challenges in reconstructing dinosaur sounds due to the lack of direct fossil evidence of vocal organs. However, by examining the vocal anatomy of living descendants and understanding the physics of sound production, scientists can make educated guesses about the sounds dinosaurs might have made.\n\nIn contrast to scientific findings, the iconic roars of dinosaurs in movies like Jurassic Park were created using sound effects from other animals, such as alligators and lions, and then digitally altered to produce the deep, resonant roars audiences have come to associate with these ancient creatures. The sound designer for Jurassic Park, Gary Rydstrom, explained that the goal was to create a sound that felt both familiar and otherworldly, capturing the imagination of viewers.\n\nThis research not only reshapes our understanding of dinosaur behavior and ecology but also highlights the importance of scientific inquiry in challenging and refining popular perceptions.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The team has successfully reconstructed YouTube videos from the brain activity of viewers, a feat that could potentially allow us to see through another person's eyes. This groundbreaking research, published in Current Biology, opens up the possibility of gaining insight into our dreams, memories, and even fantasies.\n\nThe study involved subjects watching YouTube videos inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. The researchers then developed a computer model that matched features of the videos, such as colors and movements, with patterns of brain activity. By running the brain activity data backwards through the model, the team was able to reconstruct the videos as seen by the subjects' minds. The resulting videos are blurry and dream-like, as they layer all the YouTube clips that matched the subject's brain activity.\n\nThis technology could have far-reaching implications, from broadcasting imagery from our minds to helping paralyzed individuals control their environment by imagining movements. However, the researchers caution that the technology is still in its early stages and much more work is needed to fully understand how the brain processes visual information.\n\nThe study's lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, emphasized the importance of understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, such as watching movies. \"Our natural visual experience is like watching a movie,\" Nishimoto said. \"To develop this technology further, we need to understand how the brain processes these experiences.\"\n\nWhile the potential applications of this technology are exciting, the researchers also acknowledge the ethical implications.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The explosions, which occurred near Omayyad Square, resulted in heavy gunfire and a raging fire within the compound. The blasts were followed by hours of sporadic gun battles, with black smoke rising from the heavily guarded area. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the clashes resulted in casualties on both sides.\n\nThe attacks were claimed by the Free Syrian Army, who have been increasingly targeting government sites in an effort to topple President Bashar Assad's regime.

During the eclipse, the moon will take on a reddish hue, earning it the nickname \"blood moon.\"\n\nAstronomers and skywatchers are eagerly anticipating this event, as it offers a rare opportunity to observe a supermoon, blue moon, and total lunar eclipse all in one night. The best time to view the eclipse will be just after moonrise, when the moon is sitting on the horizon, creating an illusion of an even larger and brighter moon. However, the eclipse will be visible for several hours, so there will be plenty of opportunities to catch a glimpse of this celestial spectacle.\n\nIn conclusion, the January 31, 2018, super blue blood moon eclipse is a once-in-a-lifetime event that will captivate skywatchers and astronomers alike. Whether viewed in person or through a live stream, this rare celestial phenomenon is sure to leave a lasting impression on all who witness it.", "answers": ["Look up at the sky on Jan. 31 and you may witness a sight unseen for 150 years. For the first time since 1866, a total lunar eclipse will occur with the blue moon, or second full moon of the month, which—like the one visible on New Year's Day—will also be a supermoon. Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises. Not in an ideal viewing area? The Virtual Telescope plans to livestream the total eclipse from Australia, which you can watch here, per Quartz.

According to a comprehensive study published in the Lancet medical journal, the number of overweight or obese individuals worldwide has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013, representing nearly 30% of the global population. This alarming trend is not limited to developed nations; in fact, two-thirds of the world's obese population resides in developing countries.\n\nThe study, conducted by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, analyzed data from 188 countries over several decades. It found that obesity rates have risen in both men and women, with the most significant increases observed in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United States. The Middle East and North Africa region, as well as Central America and the Pacific Islands, have reached staggering obesity rates, with more than 60% of adults in some countries being overweight or obese.\n\nObesity is a complex issue with multiple contributing factors, including increased consumption of high-calorie, low-nutrient foods, sedentary lifestyles, and changes in dietary patterns. The availability of cheap, processed foods has made it easier for people to consume more calories than they burn, leading to weight gain. Additionally, the rise of sedentary jobs and leisure activities has reduced the amount of physical activity people engage in daily.\n\nThe consequences of obesity are severe, as it is a major risk factor for numerous chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The World Health Organization estimates that obesity-related complications result in approximately 3.4 million deaths annually.\n\nDespite the growing awareness of the obesity crisis, no country has successfully reduced its obesity rates. However, there is a glimmer of hope in developed nations, where the rate of increase in obesity has slowed down in recent years. This suggests that public health interventions, such as promoting healthier diets and increasing physical activity, may be starting to have an impact.\n\nIn conclusion, the global obesity epidemic is a pressing public health issue that requires urgent attention and action.
