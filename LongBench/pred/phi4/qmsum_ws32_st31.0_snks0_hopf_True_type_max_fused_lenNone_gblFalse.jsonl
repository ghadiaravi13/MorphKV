{"pred": " The discussion about selecting channels involved several points. Marketing suggested that users often want to switch between a few favorite channels quickly, proposing a feature where users can set up to four favorite channels and cycle through them with a single button. The Industrial Designer agreed, noting that this would simplify the design and reduce the need for multiple buttons. The Technical Expert raised concerns about the complexity of implementing this feature, especially for users who might want to add or remove channels frequently. The Marketing Expert suggested that the feature could be optional, allowing users to choose whether to use it. The Industrial Designer proposed a compromise, suggesting a design where users could easily switch between a set number of channels without needing to reprogram the remote frequently. The Technical Expert agreed that this could be feasible with some adjustments to the existing design.", "answers": ["The marketing thought it not easy to keep pressing 'next' to get to the channel people wanted. Then the user interface designer offered a solution that users could set up the channels that they often watched as one, two, and three so that they would never have to go through dozens of channels. However, in the Marketing's previous presentation, some people did love zapping, so the user interface designer suggested carrying out some research to find out how many people really needed to skip from one channel to another."], "all_classes": null, "length": 7338}
