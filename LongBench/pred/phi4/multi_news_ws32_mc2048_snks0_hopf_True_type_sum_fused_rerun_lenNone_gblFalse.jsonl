{"pred": " \n\nCigarette smoke has been found to significantly increase the virulence and resistance of the superbug MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) to immune defenses, according to recent studies conducted by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine. The studies, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, reveal that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides, which are crucial components of the immune system's defense mechanisms. This increased resistance allows MRSA to better adhere to human cells, enhancing its ability to invade and cause infections.\n\nThe research indicates that cigarette smoke alters the cell walls of MRSA, making it more difficult for immune cells, such as macrophages, to kill the bacteria. In laboratory tests, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was found to be four times more resistant to macrophage killing compared to non-exposed MRSA. Furthermore, the increased resistance persisted for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting that the bacteria could pass on this enhanced resistance to their descendants.\n\nThe studies also compared the effects of cigarette smoke and e-cigarette vapor on MRSA. While both types of smoke increased the bacteria's resistance, cigarette smoke had a significantly more pronounced effect, making MRSA ten times more resistant than when exposed to e-cigarette vapor. In animal models, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke caused a significant increase in mortality compared to non-exposed MRSA.\n\nThese findings suggest that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes pathogens like MRSA more aggressive and difficult to treat.

Recently, a forensic investigation conducted by researchers Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli has cast further doubt on its authenticity. The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, utilized bloodstain pattern analysis to examine the blood-like stains on the shroud. The researchers used both real and synthetic blood to replicate the blood flow from wounds depicted on the shroud, comparing the results to the patterns on the cloth.\n\nTheir findings revealed significant inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns. For instance, the angles and directions of the blood flow from the wounds did not match what would be expected if the shroud were a genuine burial cloth of a crucified man. The researchers found that the bloodstains on the shroud were inconsistent with each other and with the positions of a body laid flat. Specifically, the blood flow from the wounds on the left hand, forearms, chest, and lower back did not align with the patterns seen on the shroud. The study concluded that the bloodstains appeared to be from a standing model rather than a crucified man.\n\nRadiocarbon dating has previously dated the shroud to between 1260 and 1390 CE, suggesting it is a medieval artifact rather than an ancient relic. Despite this, the shroud continues to be revered by some Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus. The Vatican regards it as an icon rather than a genuine relic, and the church has not officially weighed in on its authenticity.\n\nThe forensic analysis adds to the body of evidence suggesting that the Shroud of Turin is not an authentic burial cloth but rather a medieval creation. The inconsistencies in the bloodstain patterns, combined with the radiocarbon dating results, point to the shroud being an artistic or didactic representation from the 14th century.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

The film is a remake of the 1941 classic, aiming to blend gothic horror with modern special effects. Critics highlight the film's attempt to fuse the atmospheric storytelling of the original with contemporary violence and CGI, resulting in a mixed reception.\n\nThe first passage critiques the film's hybrid nature, noting that it struggles to balance gothic elements with modern horror tropes. Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of Lawrence Talbot is compared unfavorably to Lon Chaney Jr.'s iconic performance, with Del Toro's interpretation seen as lacking the same depth and intensity. The film's makeup effects, provided by veteran Rick Baker, are described as an uneasy mix of traditional and CGI techniques, which detracts from the overall impact. The narrative, set in 1890s England, follows Lawrence Talbot's return to his family estate after a mysterious disappearance, only to discover a werewolf curse that threatens his loved ones.\n\nThe second passage echoes these sentiments, emphasizing the film's visual beauty but criticizing its execution.

Led by Dr. Jim Leary from the University of Reading, the digs at Marden Henge and Wilsford Henge have revealed a wealth of artifacts and structures that date back over 4,000 years.\n\nAt Marden Henge, one of the largest prehistoric monuments in the country, archaeologists have uncovered a well-preserved Neolithic house. This rectangular structure, believed to be one of the best-preserved from the period in the UK, was discovered on the edge of the henge, which has been largely buried under rich farmland. The house, which was likely used for temporary gatherings and feasts, was adorned with white chalk plaster and contained numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch. The discovery of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggests that the house was not a permanent residence but was used for large gatherings.\n\nIn addition to the house, the site has yielded other significant finds, such as shale and copper bracelets, and the tiny jawbone of a vole. Analysis of seeds and charred grains will provide insights into the diet and agricultural practices of the people who lived there. The site, which once featured a massive enclosure with ramparts three meters high, is believed to have been a display of wealth and power, showcasing the ability to mobilize a large workforce.\n\nMeanwhile, at Wilsford Henge, archaeologists have unearthed a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton believed to be that of a child. The body, found in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace, is undergoing scientific analysis to determine its gender, diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig aimed at understanding the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. The Vale of Pewsey dig, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum, has already produced numerous artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch.\n\nThe findings from these excavations are expected to enhance our understanding of the prehistoric landscape and the people who inhabited it.

Strayed's story of self-discovery and healing through hiking the PCT has inspired many to embark on their own journeys along the trail. However, this surge in interest has raised concerns about overcrowding and the potential negative impact on the trail and its environment.\n\nThe PCT, which stretches 2,650 miles from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, has seen a steady increase in the number of hikers attempting the full trail. In 2016, over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits were issued, with more than 3,000 hikers attempting the northbound thru-hike. This is a significant increase from the 300 hikers who attempted the full trail in 2006, the year Strayed completed her hike.\n\nTo manage the growing number of hikers and mitigate environmental damage, the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) introduced a permit system in 2015, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day. This system aims to spread out hikers and reduce wear and tear on the trail, particularly in the fragile desert environments that dominate the first 700 miles of the trail.\n\nDespite these efforts, concerns about overcrowding persist. Many hikers, both experienced and inexperienced, are drawn to the trail in search of personal transformation and healing. However, this influx of hikers can lead to increased strain on trail resources, such as water and waste management, and can negatively impact the experience for other hikers.\n\nThe PCTA and the hiking community are working to promote responsible hiking practices and minimize the impact of increased hiker numbers.

The dinosaur's name, Caihong juji, translates to \"rainbow with a big crest,\" reflecting its colorful plumage and distinctive head crest.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of paleontologists led by Xing Xu and Dongyu Hu, with significant contributions from researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The fossil was unearthed in Hebei Province and is notable for its exceptional preservation, allowing scientists to study the melanosomes within the feathers. These melanosomes are pigment-containing organelles that determine feather color, and their arrangement in Caihong's feathers closely resembles that of modern hummingbirds, suggesting iridescent qualities.\n\nCaihong's body structure combines features of both dinosaurs and birds. It had a bird-like body with asymmetrical flight feathers, indicating potential gliding capabilities, though it likely did not achieve powered flight.

They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

The couple, from Stockport, had decided against summiting Tryfan as dusk approached and instead used Mr. Wilson's smartphone to find a route down. However, the app's limited detail compared to a traditional map led them to traverse the mountain's west face, known for its loose rocks and steep inclines.\n\nDuring the descent, Mrs. Wilson went ahead to scout a suitable route. Mr. Wilson, concerned for her safety, asked if it was safe to proceed, and they agreed to only continue if both were comfortable.

The Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team eventually led him to safety and found Mrs. Wilson's body approximately 150 meters below, having fallen 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff before tumbling further.\n\nThe inquest, led by John Gittins, the coroner for North Wales East and Central, concluded that Mrs. Wilson's death was accidental. It was noted that the light boots she wore were unsuitable for the rough terrain, potentially contributing to her fall. Det Con Tim Bird, the leader of the rescue team, emphasized that the route change was an attempt to avoid the summit but suggested that retreating the way they came or taking the North Ridge would have been safer. He also highlighted the risks of relying solely on electronic navigation aids, which can lack detail and suffer from battery issues.\n\nChris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Rescue team, described the route as \"not a straightforward path\" and noted that Tryfan is responsible for about 30% of the incidents the team attends.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the cost of sugary drinks, was introduced with the intention of reducing sugar consumption, raising revenue for community projects, and subsidizing healthy food for low-income families. Former Mayor Ed Murray touted it as a progressive measure, but the tax has faced strong opposition from various groups, including businesses, labor unions, and even some public health advocates.\n\nThe tax has led to a substantial increase in the price of sugary beverages. For example, a case of Gatorade at Costco saw its price jump by over 64%, prompting customers to seek alternatives outside the city limits. This exodus has resulted in a significant loss of revenue for Seattle, as residents and businesses alike have shifted their purchasing habits to avoid the tax. The situation mirrors what happened in Philadelphia and Cook County, Illinois, where similar taxes were repealed due to public backlash and economic impact.\n\nCritics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals who are more likely to purchase sugary drinks. They also point out that the tax does not apply uniformly, exempting certain beverages like milk-based drinks and those sold in restaurants, which undermines its effectiveness and fairness. Furthermore, the tax has been criticized for its potential to harm local businesses, as seen in the case of Costco, which has openly directed customers to its suburban locations to avoid the tax.\n\nDespite the controversy, some public health advocates support the tax, arguing that it can lead to healthier consumption habits and generate funds for beneficial community programs.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent studies have raised concerns about the safety of acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, during pregnancy. Researchers have found that frequent use of acetaminophen by pregnant women may be associated with an increased risk of ADHD and similar behavioral problems in their children. The studies, conducted in Denmark and published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics, analyzed data from over 64,000 children and their mothers. The findings suggest that prenatal exposure to acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD-like behaviors in children, although the studies do not establish a direct cause-and-effect relationship.\n\nThe researchers caution that pregnant women should avoid frequent use of acetaminophen until more studies are conducted. Dr. Beate Ritz, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who worked on the study, emphasized that chronic or long-term use of acetaminophen during pregnancy should be avoided. However, she also noted that taking acetaminophen occasionally does not necessarily mean a child will develop hyperactivity or ADHD.\n\nThe studies also highlighted the importance of considering nonpharmacological methods for pain relief during pregnancy, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture. Dr. Jeffrey Chapa of Cleveland Clinic Children’s Hospital suggested that pregnant women should weigh the risks and benefits of taking acetaminophen and consider alternative pain relief methods.\n\nMcNeil Consumer Healthcare, the maker of Tylenol, stated that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development. They emphasized that Tylenol has one of the most favorable safety profiles among over-the-counter pain relievers when used as directed.\n\nThe studies underscore the complexity of ADHD, which is influenced by genetic, environmental, and possibly prenatal factors. While the findings are significant, they do not suggest that acetaminophen use during pregnancy directly causes ADHD. Pregnant women are advised to consult their doctors before taking any medication and to consider the potential risks and benefits carefully.\n\nIn conclusion, while the studies raise important questions about the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, more research is needed to fully understand the potential risks. Pregnant women should be cautious about frequent use of acetaminophen and explore alternative pain relief methods, while healthcare providers should continue to monitor and study the effects of medications during pregnancy.", "answers": ["The bad news about acetaminophen just keeps on coming: A new study finds that use of the drug during pregnancy is linked to \"ADHD-like behavioral problems\" in children, CNN reports.

The House of Representatives, led by Speaker John Boehner, passed a plan to fund the government through December 15, but with conditions attached, including delaying the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare. This move was seen as an attempt to appease conservative members of the Republican Party who were opposed to the ACA.\n\nThe Senate, controlled by Democrats, was expected to reject the House's proposal, as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and President Obama both stated they would not negotiate over the ACA. Reid urged the Senate to pass a clean funding bill without any conditions attached to it, which would then be sent back to the House. The impasse was largely due to the Republican strategy to use the funding bill as leverage to defund or delay the ACA.\n\nAs the deadline approached, the possibility of a government shutdown loomed, with significant consequences for federal employees and the economy. An estimated 800,000 federal workers faced furloughs, and many government services would be suspended. The Washington region, with its high concentration of federal workers and contractors, was projected to lose $200 million a day if the shutdown occurred.\n\nThe political standoff highlighted the deep divisions between the two parties, with Republicans accused of risking a shutdown to undermine the ACA, and Democrats accused of refusing to negotiate on the issue. The situation was further complicated by the upcoming debt ceiling debate, which threatened to lead to another fiscal crisis if not resolved.\n\nAs the deadline passed without a resolution, the government entered a partial shutdown, affecting various federal agencies and services.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The reliquary, decorated with crosses, is less than an inch long and is one of only 43 known lead tubes from that era, highlighting its rarity and significance.\n\nIn addition to the relic, the excavation uncovered a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal, further emphasizing the site's historical importance. The fortress, known as Burgos (or Poros) on Cape Foros, has been a focal point of archaeological interest since 2008, revealing a complex history spanning from the Roman Empire to the Ottoman period. The site includes structures from the 3rd to the 15th centuries, such as a Roman villa and a Byzantine basilica.\n\nThe discovery of the reliquary is particularly notable given the historical context of early Christian pilgrimage. Pilgrims traveled to sites like Ephesus, where John the Apostle was believed to be buried, seeking healing and spiritual solace. The reliquary's images are identical to those on clay tubes from Ephesus, suggesting a direct connection to this pilgrimage center.\n\nThis find is part of a broader pattern of relic discoveries in the region, including a 2010 find of a reliquary containing relics of St. John the Baptist on St. Ivan Island, which has garnered international attention. These discoveries underscore the rich religious and cultural history of the Black Sea region and its significance in early Christian history. The ongoing excavations at Burgos continue to reveal the area's complex past, offering new insights into the lives and beliefs of its ancient inhabitants.", "answers": ["Archaeologists in Bulgaria think they've found ashes belonging to one of the 12 apostles.

Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, has discovered over 30 dwarf planets and played a key role in the demotion of Pluto in 2006 after the discovery of Eris, a dwarf planet similar in size to Pluto. This led to the redefinition of what constitutes a planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nThe evidence for Planet Nine comes from mathematical modeling and computer simulations that suggest the presence of a large, icy body in the far reaches of our solar system, influencing the orbits of other distant objects. Brown and his colleague Konstantin (Kai) Batygin published their findings in the Astronomical Journal, proposing that this planet is about ten times the mass of Earth and orbits the sun at a great distance, taking approximately 15,000 years to complete one orbit.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is significant as it could help explain the unusual orbits of other trans-Neptunian objects and provide insights into the formation and evolution of our solar system. While the planet has not yet been directly observed, Brown and Batygin believe that it could be detected with current telescopes within the next few years.\n\nBrown's work has been met with both acclaim and controversy. He has faced criticism from those who wish to reinstate Pluto as a planet, but he maintains that the reclassification was necessary for a better understanding of our solar system. The discovery of Planet Nine has reignited interest in the outer solar system and could lead to a reevaluation of what we consider to be a planet.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of Planet Nine represents a major advancement in our understanding of the solar system's structure and history.

CAD is a condition where the coronary arteries, responsible for supplying blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the heart, become damaged or diseased due to plaque buildup and inflammation. This can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, and even heart attacks.\n\nThe studies, led by Dr. Sripal Bangalore from the New York University School of Medicine, followed 9,509 men and women with stable CAD over five years. They found that those with the highest weight variability had significantly higher risks of new-onset diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, and death compared to those with the lowest weight variability. Specifically, the highest weight variability group had a 78% higher risk of diabetes, 117% higher risk of heart attacks, 136% higher risk of strokes, and 124% higher risk of death.\n\nThe research, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, emphasizes the importance of maintaining a stable weight rather than experiencing large fluctuations. Dr. Bangalore noted that while losing weight is important, it is crucial to keep it off to avoid these severe health risks. The study also pointed out that the findings are observational and cannot definitively prove cause-and-effect, but they do raise significant concerns about weight fluctuation in individuals with CAD.\n\nIn addition to the findings on weight variability, the studies also discussed the broader implications of CAD, which is the most common form of heart disease in the United States, causing over 370,000 deaths annually. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can block blood flow to the heart.\n\nOverall, the research underscores the need for further investigation into how to help individuals with CAD maintain a stable weight and avoid the detrimental effects of yo-yo dieting.

The problem was discovered on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down after reaching a pre-set temperature limit. This malfunction forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B, leading to a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost. The crew, consisting of two Americans, three Russians, and a Japanese astronaut, had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab.\n\nThe issue is believed to be caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Engineers are currently trying to determine whether a software fix can resolve the problem or if a spacewalk will be necessary. The decision on whether an emergency spacewalk is required could take a couple of days or even weeks. If a spacewalk is needed, it would be part of the \"Big 14\" maintenance issues that NASA and its partners expect to face occasionally during space station operations.\n\nDespite the cooling system problem, NASA has assured that the station and its crew were never in any danger.

The University of Michigan study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren, analyzed data from nearly 260,000 colorectal cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011. The findings revealed that 15% of these patients were younger than 50, and these younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer. Despite this, younger patients often received more aggressive treatment and had slightly better survival rates compared to older patients.\n\nThe study highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening guidelines for younger adults. Current guidelines recommend starting colorectal cancer screening at age 50, but the study suggests that nearly 15% of patients could be diagnosed late if these guidelines are not adjusted.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

Kardashev's model outlines three types of civilizations based on their energy consumption: Type I harnesses all the resources of a planet, Type II harnesses all the radiation of a star, and Type III harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. \n\nRecent research by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, suggests that harvesting energy from distant stars is crucial for civilizations to avoid being left alone in an ever-expanding universe. Hooper's paper, posted on arXiv.org, argues that the accelerating expansion of the universe due to dark energy will eventually make stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. To counter this, advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies and harvest their energy before they become unreachable. \n\nHooper proposes that such civilizations could use a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and utilize a star's energy. These structures, first described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon and later proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson, would consist of millions of solar-powered satellites forming a spherical shell around a star. The satellites would collect the star's energy and beam it back to the home planet. \n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been a popular theme in science fiction, appearing in works such as Olaf Stapledon's \"Star Maker,\" Larry Niven's \"Ringworld,\" and the \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\" episode \"Relics.\" \n\nWhile humans are currently at a Type I civilization level, with an estimated rating of 0.7 on Kardashev's scale, it is believed that we could reach Type II within a few thousand years and Type III within a few hundred thousand to a million years. However, detecting such advanced civilizations and their mega-structures remains a challenge, as current instruments may not be precise enough to identify the unusual light signatures produced by star-harvesting activities. \n\nIn summary, the news passages explore the idea of advanced civilizations harnessing energy from stars and galaxies to survive in an ever-expanding universe, with Dyson spheres being a potential solution for capturing and utilizing a star's energy.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Despite initial treatment with antibiotics, the infection recurred, leading to the discovery of stage 3 kidney reflux, a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidneys, increasing the risk of infections.\n\nComplicating her condition, Oakleigh contracted a dangerous, antibiotic-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that can cause serious infections, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. This infection, coupled with her kidney issues, has made her treatment challenging. Pseudomonas infections are notorious for their resistance to many antibiotics, making them difficult to treat, especially in hospital settings where the bacteria can spread through various means.\n\nIn addition to her kidney and infection issues, Oakleigh was diagnosed with moderate atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary stenosis, heart conditions that are particularly concerning given her overall health status. These conditions necessitate careful monitoring and further testing by a cardiologist.\n\nDespite these challenges, Oakleigh is scheduled for surgery to address the reflux in her left kidney, which has reduced functionality. The procedure aims to prevent future infections by correcting the reflux. Her family remains hopeful, supported by their faith and the love of those around them. They are also raising funds through a GoFundMe account to cover medical expenses.\n\nIn a related development, Oakleigh has contracted a \"super strain\" of E. coli, another serious bacterial infection. This strain is resistant to many antibiotics, further complicating her treatment. Her family is concerned about the limited treatment options available due to her extensive antibiotic exposure.

Despite this, city officials decided to drain the water to ensure public health, a decision that has drawn criticism and disbelief from both local and national media.\n\nSwonger, an 18-year-old skateboarder, was cited for trespassing and public urination after being caught on surveillance video near the reservoir early Wednesday morning.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent archaeological findings in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have significantly altered our understanding of early human behavior and technological advancement. These discoveries, reported in three papers published in the journal Science, suggest that Homo sapiens or their close relatives developed advanced tool-making techniques and established long-distance trading networks as early as 320,000 years ago, much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe excavations revealed that dramatic shifts in the East African climate around 320,000 years ago may have driven these early humans to innovate and adapt. The newly discovered tools, which include smaller, more standardized points and blades, indicate a significant technological shift from the earlier, bulkier Acheulean hand axes. This transition to Middle Stone Age technology is characterized by the use of obsidian, a volcanic glass, which was sourced from locations up to 50 kilometers away, suggesting the existence of long-distance trade networks.\n\nThe findings also include evidence of the use of pigments, with the discovery of ochre, which may have been used for symbolic purposes. This suggests that early humans engaged in behaviors that are considered markers of modern cognition, such as symbolic thinking and social networking.\n\nPaleoanthropologist Rick Potts and his team propose that these technological and social innovations were responses to environmental pressures, such as climate variability and resource scarcity. The ability to adapt to changing conditions by developing new tools and establishing trade networks would have been crucial for survival.\n\nThe research also challenges the notion of a \"human revolution\" that occurred around 50,000 years ago, which was previously thought to mark the emergence of modern human behavior. Instead, the evidence from Olorgesailie suggests that the roots of modern human behavior, including technological innovation and complex social interactions, began much earlier.\n\nThese findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution. They suggest that the cognitive and cultural capabilities that define modern humans were present in our ancestors much earlier than previously believed.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

He was listed as the second most wanted Nazi war criminal by the Simon Wiesenthal Center. \n\nKatriuk was accused of participating in the massacre of villagers in Belarus in 1943 while serving in a Ukrainian battalion of the Waffen SS. Despite these allegations, the Canadian government had previously refused to revoke his citizenship, citing a lack of evidence. In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that Katriuk had lied about his voluntary service for the German authorities to obtain Canadian citizenship. However, in 2007, the Canadian government decided not to revoke his citizenship due to insufficient evidence of his involvement in war crimes.\n\nThe Russian government had recently charged Katriuk with genocide in connection with the 1943 massacre and called on Canada to extradite him for trial. However, Canada rejected this request, maintaining its stance against Russia's annexation of Crimea and interference in Ukraine. \n\nKatriuk's death has sparked renewed calls for justice from Jewish organizations, who have long urged his deportation. The Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs urged the Canadian government to ensure that Katriuk would be held accountable if found guilty of war crimes. However, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress argued that the Russian investigation was a distraction from Russia's actions in Ukraine and urged Canada to ignore the extradition request.\n\nIn a separate case, German prosecutors have dropped their investigation into a 93-year-old former SS officer, Gerhard Sommer, due to his dementia.

This move, which has been in discussion for decades, marks a pivotal shift in the country's drug policy. The new law, passed by Jamaican lawmakers, reduces possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6 grams) of marijuana to a petty offense, avoiding criminal records for individuals caught with small quantities. Additionally, the cultivation of up to five plants is now permitted, reflecting the drug's cultural significance in Jamaica.\n\nThe legislation also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. This development opens the door for Jamaica to become a player in the burgeoning medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the creation of innovative marijuana-derived products. Local scientists have already made strides in this area, with products like \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve glaucoma symptoms.\n\nFor the first time, Rastafarians can legally use marijuana for religious purposes, aligning with the spiritual practices of the movement founded in Jamaica in the 1930s. Tourists prescribed medical marijuana abroad can also apply for permits to purchase small amounts of ganja legally.\n\nDespite these changes, the Jamaican government maintains a firm stance against transnational drug trafficking and illegal cultivation. National security minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the new law does not equate to a free-for-all in marijuana activities. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce laws against trafficking and illegal cultivation, consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe legislative change aligns Jamaica with a global trend of easing marijuana restrictions. In the Americas, several countries and U.S. states have decriminalized or legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use. This shift reflects a broader movement towards recognizing the potential benefits of marijuana while addressing its historical criminalization, particularly among marginalized communities.\n\nIn summary, Jamaica's decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana represents a significant step towards modernizing its drug laws, fostering economic opportunities, and addressing historical injustices.

{"pred": " \n\nMars, once a warm and wet planet, had a massive ancient ocean that covered nearly half of its northern hemisphere, making it a promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. This ocean, which held 20 million cubic kilometers of water, was a mile deep in places and spread over a fifth of the planet's surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth. The evidence for this primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5 billion years ago.\n\nScientists used three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world to study Mars and found that the Martian atmosphere is enriched in deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen. This enrichment indicates that Mars has lost a vast amount of water over time, equivalent to more than six times the water now locked up in the planet's frozen polar caps. The high concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere suggests that early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe ancient ocean on Mars lasted for millions of years, but over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned, causing more ocean water to waft into space. As a result, the planet lost much of its insulation, and the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up in the Martian polar caps.\n\nThe evidence suggests that Mars was habitable in the distant past, with long-standing bodies of water such as lakes, deltas, and perhaps even seas. While it is not clear whether Mars was ever inhabited, the possibility of life existing on the planet cannot be ruled out. The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its ExoMars rover to the red planet, which will look for chemical signatures of life.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent findings indicate that Mars was once a much wetter and warmer planet than it is today, with a significant ancient ocean that could have supported life. The evidence continues to mount that Mars was once hospitable to biology, and the notion that life might have existed on the planet is only getting stronger.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": " \n\nThe portrayal of dinosaur sounds in popular media, particularly the iconic roar of the Tyrannosaurus rex, has been a staple of cinematic history, from \"King Kong\" to \"Jurassic Park.\" However, recent research suggests that these depictions are far from accurate. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs likely did not roar as depicted in movies. Instead, their vocalizations might have been more akin to the coos and murmurs of modern birds. This conclusion is drawn from the study of closed-mouth vocalizations in birds, which produce low-frequency sounds through an esophageal pouch rather than an open beak.\n\nThe study, led by researchers from The University of Texas at Austin, Midwestern University, and other institutions, analyzed the vocal behaviors of living birds and crocodiles, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. They found that closed-mouth vocalizations, which are quieter and lower in pitch, have evolved independently at least 16 times within the archosaur group, which includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. This behavior is typically associated with large-bodied animals, suggesting that large dinosaurs like the T. rex might have used similar vocalizations.\n\nThe researchers also noted that the vocal organs of dinosaurs, unlike those of mammals, did not include vocal cords. Instead, they likely had a syrinx, a bird-like vocal organ located at the base of the trachea. This would have allowed them to produce a range of sounds, potentially including the low-frequency coos and murmurs observed in some birds today.\n\nGary Ryan, a paleontologist at the University of Texas at Austin, emphasized that while the exact sounds of dinosaurs remain speculative, the study provides valuable insights into their possible vocal behaviors. \"We can't recreate the exact sounds of dinosaurs, but by understanding the vocal mechanisms of their closest living relatives, we can make educated guesses about what they might have sounded like,\" Ryan said.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research in paleontology. By combining data from living animals, fossil records, and experimental physiology, scientists can piece together a more accurate picture of dinosaur life. This approach not only helps in understanding dinosaur vocalizations but also sheds light on their behavior and ecology.\n\nIn conclusion, while the dramatic roars of dinosaurs in movies capture the imagination, scientific research suggests a more subdued reality. Dinosaurs, particularly large ones, may have communicated with low-frequency coos and murmurs, much like some birds do today.

In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals.

{"pred": " \n\nThe recent breakthrough by researchers at UC Berkeley has brought us closer to the possibility of reading and reconstructing visual experiences directly from the brain. In a groundbreaking study, scientists have successfully pieced together YouTube videos from the brain activity of subjects who watched the same videos while lying inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine. This experiment marks a significant advancement in understanding how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, as it is the first time a continuous, dynamic visual experience has been reconstructed from brain patterns.\n\nThe study involved subjects, including the researchers themselves, who spent hours inside an MRI machine watching sets of movie trailers. The MRI recorded the blood flow in the visual cortex, which processes visual information. This data was then used to develop a \"movie reconstruction algorithm\" that matched neural activity with the dynamic information in the videos, such as shapes, images, and sounds. The algorithm was trained on 18 million seconds of random YouTube videos, allowing it to associate specific neural patterns with visual content.\n\nOnce the algorithm was developed, it was used to reconstruct videos based on the brain activity recorded during the second viewing of the trailers. The resulting videos were continuous but abstract, resembling a Surrealist painting with a dream-like quality. This continuous reconstruction of dynamic visual experiences is a significant leap from previous capabilities, which were limited to static images.\n\nThe implications of this research are profound. It opens the door to potentially seeing what is happening in the mind without external visual stimuli, such as dreams and thoughts. The technology could eventually be used to broadcast internal imagery, providing insights into dreams, memories, and even fantasies. This could have applications in helping paralyzed individuals control their environment by imagining movements or in communication for those with paralyzing conditions.\n\nHowever, the technology is still in its early stages. The brain activity measured in this study represents only a fraction of the activity involved in seeing moving images. The brain consists of numerous modules, each responsible for different aspects of visual processing. Future research aims to build models for each part of the visual system, which would improve the resolution of reconstructed images and require significant computational power.\n\nWhile the potential applications are exciting, there are ethical and practical considerations. The use of this technology in legal contexts, such as detective work or court cases, raises questions about the reliability and interpretation of reconstructed memories. As the researchers themselves acknowledge, an accurate read-out of a faulty memory would only provide misleading information.\n\nIn summary, the UC Berkeley study represents a major step forward in understanding and reconstructing visual experiences from brain activity.

The second passage criticizes the political rhetoric surrounding the sequester, highlighting that while many government services face cuts, the salaries of senators and representatives remain unaffected. The author argues that Congress is unlikely to be deterred by the sequester, as they will continue to receive their salaries and can still secure funding for projects that benefit their constituents.

The scandal involves the creation of millions of bogus accounts without customers' knowledge, leading to a $185 million penalty for the bank and the firing of 5,300 employees. Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\" and argued that he should return his earnings and be criminally investigated. She also criticized the bank's culture, which she claimed encouraged employees to cheat customers to meet cross-selling quotas. Despite Stumpf's defense that cross-selling was about deepening relationships, Warren pointed out that the bank's success in cross-selling was used to boost its stock price, benefiting Stumpf personally.\n\nIn the second topic, President Donald Trump is expected to announce that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, a decision that has been met with international criticism. The move is seen as a compromise, as Trump had previously pledged to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, a decision that would have caused a greater international uproar. The decision is expected to hinder peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians, as it contradicts the U.S.'s historical stance that Jerusalem's status should be resolved in negotiations.

Bayesian inference allows for the updating of probabilities as new information becomes available, making it a flexible tool in complex search scenarios.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, Bayesian methods helped locate the wreckage after it had been missing for two years.

The accident occurred on March 23rd on the 101 Highway near Mountain View, California, when the vehicle collided with a barrier that had been damaged in a previous accident and not repaired. Tesla confirmed that the vehicle was on autopilot with adaptive cruise control engaged at the time of the crash. Despite several warnings, the driver's hands were not detected on the wheel for six seconds before the collision, and no action was taken despite having a clear view of the barrier.\n\nThe severity of the crash was attributed to the damaged crash attenuator, a safety barrier designed to reduce impact, which had been crushed in a prior accident and not replaced. Tesla's statement highlighted that this level of damage had never been seen in any other Model X crash. Walter Huang's family revealed that he had previously complained about the vehicle veering towards the same barrier during autopilot use, but the issue could not be replicated at the dealership.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the California Department of Transportation (CalTrans) are investigating the accident. CalTrans stated that replacement work for the barrier was scheduled but delayed due to weather conditions. The previous accident that damaged the barrier occurred 11 days before Huang's fatal crash.\n\nThis incident has brought increased scrutiny to autopilot and autonomous vehicles, especially following a recent fatal accident involving an Uber autonomous vehicle in Arizona. Tesla emphasized that autopilot significantly improves safety, reducing crash rates by up to 40% and making Tesla vehicles 3.7 times less likely to be involved in a fatal accident compared to the national average.

The elections were the first since Mubarak's removal and were taking place amid his trial, where he faced charges of corruption and complicity in the killing of protesters during the uprising that led to his downfall.\n\nThe trial of Mubarak, which resumed after a hiatus, was marked by the prosecutor's characterization of Mubarak as a tyrant who had allowed his son, Gamal, to position himself as his successor, a move that was deeply unpopular among Egyptians. The prosecutor demanded the harshest penalty for Mubarak, emphasizing the need for accountability and the end of impunity for former rulers.\n\nThe political landscape was further complicated by the military's continued hold on power, with the ruling generals facing opposition from revolutionary forces who were skeptical of their intentions and their commitment to a genuine transition to democracy. The military's reluctance to cede power was evident in their control over the transitional process and their resistance to the newly elected parliament's authority.\n\nEconomically, Egypt was struggling, with foreign currency reserves declining sharply and the stock market suffering significant losses. The unrest had deterred tourists and investors, exacerbating the country's financial woes.\n\nThe news also highlighted the potential for conflict between the military rulers and the new parliament, particularly over the issue of forming a government and the military's role in the transition.
