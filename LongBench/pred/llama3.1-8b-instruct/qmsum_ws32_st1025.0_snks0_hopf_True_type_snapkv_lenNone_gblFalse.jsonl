She attributed this to a decline in the number of students training to become teachers, which was a global issue, and not unique to Wales. She mentioned that the USA, Finland, and Australia were also experiencing similar problems. She stated that the reasons for this decline were complex and multifaceted, and that it was not just about financial incentives. She mentioned that the Welsh Government had taken steps to address the issue, including making ITE provision more attractive, increasing financial incentives, and introducing a new national marketing campaign to promote teaching as a career.
