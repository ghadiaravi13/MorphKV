{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has also revealed that it can fuel the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the immune system, making it harder to kill. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the study found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, which means a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. When put into mice, the smoke-exposed MRSA showed a significant difference in mortality compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

According to Lumos, there are 8 million children worldwide who are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in atrocious conditions. The charity has been working to shed light on the lives of these children and to provide support to families who are struggling to care for their children.\n\nRowling recounts how she was inspired to start Lumos after seeing a photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. She was shocked by the conditions and the fact that the child was being held captive. She began writing letters to influential people and eventually established Lumos.\n\nThe charity has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. In Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos began working there. In the Czech Republic, there has been a 75% fall in admissions to institutions in Lumos's demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has reduced by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nRowling emphasizes that the solution to the problem of institutionalization is not to improve the conditions in institutions, but to eliminate them altogether. She argues that it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and that this also reduces long-term costs.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and Rowling is committed to making this a reality. She has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage people to get involved.\n\nRowling's message is clear: the institutionalization of children is a solvable problem, and it is up to all of us to make a difference.

The militant threat in Pakistan was highlighted on Monday with the assassination of a Saudi diplomat in Karachi, which was seen as a possible revenge attack for the killing of Osama bin Laden.

The skeleton was discovered lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The team from the University of Reading, who made the discovery, will conduct scientific analysis to determine the gender of the child, its diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig in the Vale of Pewsey, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim of the dig is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nIn addition to the skeleton, the team has also uncovered several other significant finds, including flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. These finds were discovered at Marden henge, a prehistoric monument built in 2,400 BC and believed to be the largest of its kind in the country. The team has also discovered a rectangular building at Marden henge, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved buildings from the period ever found in the UK. The building is thought to have been used for gatherings and feasts, and the team has found evidence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe team is led by Dr Jim Leary, director of the excavation, who believes that Marden henge was used for status and to show off wealth and power. The site is vast, with ramparts three meters high and a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 meters tall. The team will continue to work on the site for years to come, and the public will have the opportunity to visit the site and see the finds on display.\n\nOverall, these discoveries are significant not only for the insights they provide into the lives of people who lived in the area thousands of years ago but also for the understanding of the prehistoric monuments and landscapes of the region.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now.

The pay package, which included a $19.6 million bonus, was seen as excessive by many investors, given the company's $5.2 billion loss in 2015. Despite the opposition, the company's board defended the pay package, saying it was based on Dudley's exceptional performance in 2015.\n\nHowever, the shareholders were not convinced, and a majority of them voted against the pay package at the company's annual general meeting. The vote was non-binding, but it was seen as a significant rebuke to the company's board and Dudley. The shareholders' opposition was led by several major institutional investors, including Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management.\n\nThe opposition to Dudley's pay package was not just about the amount of money he received, but also about the fact that it was awarded at a time when the company was facing significant financial challenges. The company's loss in 2015 was its worst ever, and it has since announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs and slash its dividend.\n\nThe shareholders' vote was seen as a significant moment in the debate over executive pay in the UK. It highlighted the growing trend of institutional investors taking a more active role in scrutinizing executive pay and holding companies accountable for their decisions.\n\nThe company's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, acknowledged the strength of the shareholders' opposition and promised to review the company's pay policy. However, he also said that the company would not adjust Dudley's pay package, despite the vote.\n\nThe opposition to Dudley's pay package was not limited to the shareholders. Several corporate governance experts also criticized the pay package, saying it was excessive and not justified by the company's performance. The experts argued that the pay package was a reflection of the company's culture and values, and that it needed to be changed.\n\nIn conclusion, the shareholders' vote against Dudley's pay package was a significant moment in the debate over executive pay in the UK.

The legend, known as the Pishtacos, tells the story of mythical killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. According to Felix, the gang murdered up to 60 people and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, police in Lima, the capital, later admitted that the investigation had been botched and that there may have been only one victim. The police in Huanuco, where the alleged crimes took place, said that the four alleged killers may have bottled the victim's fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. The police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, with anthropologists saying that they foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Medical experts have also dismissed the theory that human fat has monetary value, saying that it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks. The case has also sparked concerns about the police's reputation and the impact on tourism in Peru. The police chief, Miguel Hidalgo, has apologized for the embarrassment caused by the case and has put Felix on indefinite leave from his job.

The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has reported a 300% increase in website traffic and a 50% increase in requests for permits. The PCTA has also seen an increase in the number of hikers attempting to complete the entire trail, with over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits issued in 2016.\n\nHowever, this increase in hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment. The PCTA has implemented a quota system, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day, in an effort to mitigate the wear and tear on the trail and protect the fragile desert ecosystems. Despite this, many hikers are still reporting crowded conditions, with some sections of the trail seeing up to 3,000 hikers in a short period of time.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has also put a strain on essential services, such as helicopter evacuations and searches. In the first 50 miles of the trail, there have already been 20 rescues in 2016. The PCTA is working to promote responsible hiking practices and has launched a campaign called #responsiblywild, which encourages hikers to follow the principles of leave-no-trace and to respect the environment.\n\nSome hikers are expressing concerns about the impact of overcrowding on the trail experience. Rusty, a 71-year-old hiker who completed the trail in 2003, said that he misses the quieter days and would like to hike without seeing a line of ants all the way to Canada. The PCTA is working to balance the needs of hikers with the need to protect the environment and preserve the integrity of the trail.\n\nIn addition to the concerns about overcrowding, there are also concerns about the impact of inexperienced hikers on the trail. Some hikers are embarking on the trail without proper preparation, which can put themselves and others at risk. The PCTA is encouraging hikers to be prepared and to follow the principles of responsible hiking.\n\nOverall, the increased popularity of the PCT has brought both benefits and challenges.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

Wright's death was announced by her literary agents, who stated that she had been ill for several months.\n\nBorn in 1947, Wright grew up in a wealthy family in London and was raised by her surgeon father, who was also an alcoholic. She became a barrister at the age of 21, but her career was cut short due to her struggles with alcoholism. Wright eventually turned her life around and began working as a cook, eventually becoming a renowned chef and food historian.\n\nWright's television career began with Two Fat Ladies, which premiered in 1996 and ran for four seasons. The show was known for its irreverent humor and Wright's strong personality, which often clashed with her co-host Paterson. After Paterson's death in 1999, Wright continued to work in television, hosting several shows, including Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.\n\nIn addition to her television work, Wright was a prolific writer and published several books on food and cooking.

The couple had decided not to climb to the summit due to the approaching dusk, and instead attempted to traverse the west face of the mountain. However, Jane fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff and then tumbled 150 meters down into a rocky area. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.\n\nThe incident highlights the risks of relying solely on electronic navigation aids, such as smartphone apps, when navigating the outdoors. Experts have warned that these apps can be unreliable, especially in areas with limited cell phone reception or when the battery is running low. They recommend carrying a paper map and compass as a backup, and to always be aware of the terrain and potential hazards.\n\nThe Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team was called to the scene and led Gary Wilson to safety, but unfortunately, they were unable to recover Jane's body until two days later. The team's leader, Detective Constable Tim Bird, said that the couple's decision to traverse the west face was an attempt to avoid the summit, but it was not a safe route. He also noted that the light boots worn by Jane were not suitable for the rough terrain.\n\nJane Wilson was a fit and active woman who had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years. She was a librarian at Manchester University and had also completed several marathons. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of being prepared and aware of the risks when engaging in outdoor activities.\n\nThe incident has also raised questions about the safety of using smartphone apps for navigation in the outdoors. While these apps can be convenient, they can also be misleading or unreliable. Experts recommend using a combination of navigation tools, including paper maps, compasses, and GPS devices, to ensure a safe and enjoyable outdoor experience. \n\nIn related news, Chris Lloyd, a member of the Ogwen Rescue team, said that Tryfan is responsible for about 30% of the incidents the team has to attend. He warned that the North Ridge of Tryfan is a hazardous route, especially for inexperienced climbers.

{"pred": " \nSeattle’s new sweetened beverage tax, which went into effect on January 1, 2018, has been met with widespread criticism and opposition. The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sweetened drinks, has been touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption and improve public health. However, many residents and business owners are speaking out against the tax, citing its regressive nature and the negative impact it will have on low-income families.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of the tax is Costco, which has posted signs directing customers to its stores outside of Seattle to avoid the tax. The company has also increased the price of its drinks by 64 cents per gallon to account for the tax. Other retailers, such as Starbucks, have also been affected by the tax, with some locations posting signs indicating that the tax will be passed on to customers.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of exemptions for certain types of sweetened beverages, such as those sold at Starbucks. This has led to accusations that the tax is unfairly targeting low-income families, who are more likely to purchase sweetened drinks at convenience stores and other retailers.\n\nIn addition to the criticism from residents and business owners, the tax has also been met with opposition from lawmakers in other parts of the state. A bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to repeal the tax, citing concerns about its impact on local businesses and the economy.\n\nThe tax has also been compared to a similar tax implemented in Cook County, Illinois, which was repealed after just two months due to widespread opposition. The tax in Cook County added 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sweetened drinks, and was met with fierce resistance from retailers and consumers.\n\nDespite the criticism, supporters of the tax argue that it is a necessary step to reduce sugar consumption and improve public health. They point to studies that show a link between sugar consumption and a range of health problems, including obesity and diabetes.\n\nHowever, opponents of the tax argue that it is a regressive tax that will disproportionately affect low-income families. They also argue that the tax will drive business out of the city and harm the local economy.\n\nAs the debate over the tax continues, it remains to be seen whether it will be successful in reducing sugar consumption and improving public health.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}
{"pred": " \nThe recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have raised concerns about the security of customer information. According to reports, Neiman Marcus was hacked as far back as July, but the breach was not fully contained until January 1st. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner and has offered customers one free year of credit monitoring.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target was also hacked, resulting in the theft of credit and debit card data for over 100 million customers. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for millions of customers. The report details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.\n\nThe report suggests that the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it, unencrypted. The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\"\n\nThe report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach. The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches.\n\nThe report also suggests that the data breach was part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and other personal information belonging to 70 million people. The authorities are still investigating the source of the attack, but it is believed to have originated from Eastern Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have highlighted the need for retailers to improve their security measures to protect customer information. The use of malware and other sophisticated hacking techniques has made it easier for cyber crooks to steal sensitive information, and it is likely that we will see more of this type of breach in the future.

The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed.

In Kenya, a 13-year-old lion named Mohawk, also known as the \"ladies lion\" due to his distinctive black mane, was shot dead by wildlife rangers after he attacked a man in a crowd. The lion had escaped from Nairobi National Park, where he was a popular tourist attraction, and was surrounded by hundreds of people who were trying to take selfies with him. The rangers claimed that they had no choice but to shoot the lion as he posed an immediate threat to human life.\n\nHowever, many Kenyans have expressed outrage and disappointment over the killing of Mohawk, with some calling for an investigation into the incident. The hashtag #JusticeforMohawk has been trending on social media, with many people questioning why the rangers did not try to tranquilize the lion instead of killing him.\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the safety of wildlife in Kenya's national parks, particularly in Nairobi National Park, which has seen several lion escapes in recent weeks. The park's electric fence has been damaged, and conservationists have pointed to habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict as major factors contributing to the lion escapes.\n\nIn a separate incident in South Africa, a lion named Sylvester has escaped from Karoo National Park and is currently being hunted by wildlife officials. The officials have vowed to put the lion down once they capture him, but conservationists have launched a campaign to save the lion, using the hashtag #SaveSylvester.\n\nThe incidents have highlighted the complex issues surrounding the conservation of lions in Africa, where their numbers have declined dramatically over the past century due to habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the African lion as a \"vulnerable\" species, and conservationists are working to protect the remaining lion populations and their habitats.\n\nOverall, the incidents have sparked a national conversation in Kenya and South Africa about the importance of protecting wildlife and their habitats, and the need for more effective conservation efforts to prevent such incidents in the future. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not take a stance on the issue.

The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it.

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nA new study suggests that rapidly losing and regaining weight, or “yo-yo” dieting, may increase the risk for deadly heart attacks and strokes in people with coronary artery disease. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest changes in body weight had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those who experienced the smallest body weight changes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that it's essential to lose weight, but it's also crucial to keep it off. He suggests that the findings may be used as motivation to keep the weight off. The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCoronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to angina or heart attack.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. The researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with coronary heart disease and suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.

The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

{"pred": " \nColorectal cancer, often considered a disease that affects older men, is increasingly being diagnosed in younger individuals. According to a recent study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This trend is raising concerns among medical professionals, who are urging the medical community to be more vigilant in screening for the disease in younger patients. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, but they also tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment. The researchers believe that this finding suggests the need for improved risk assessment and screening for younger adults. They also recommend that doctors be more aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits. In addition, they suggest that individuals with a family history of colon cancer should begin screening earlier than the age of 50. The study's findings have sparked debate about whether screening guidelines should be changed to start at a younger age. While some experts argue that the data does not support expanding screening to younger age groups, others believe that the increasing incidence of colon cancer in younger adults warrants a reevaluation of current guidelines. Ultimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in screening for colorectal cancer, particularly in younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": " \nArchaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, uncovering evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years. The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has yielded a treasure trove of artefacts, including stone tools, ochre, and burnt eggshells, which have been dated to between 49,000 and 49,000 years ago. This discovery pushes back the known history of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by at least 10,000 years.\n\nThe site was discovered by chance by archaeologist Giles Hamm, who was surveying the area with local Aboriginal elders. Hamm and his team have been excavating the site for several years, and their findings have been published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe artefacts found at the site include some of the oldest known stone tools in Australia, as well as evidence of early human use of ochre, a pigment used for art and ceremonial purposes. The team has also found evidence of early human interaction with megafauna, including the remains of giant marsupials and birds.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human history in Australia, and challenges the long-held assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative or technologically advanced as other cultures. The team's findings suggest that Indigenous Australians were capable of developing complex technologies and adapting to their environment in a highly effective way.\n\nThe site is also significant because it provides evidence of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia, which was previously thought to be uninhabitable due to its harsh climate. The discovery suggests that early humans were able to adapt to this environment and thrive in it.\n\nThe team's findings have been met with excitement and interest from the scientific community, with many experts hailing the discovery as one of the most significant in Australian archaeology in recent years. The discovery is also significant for the local Aboriginal community, who have been involved in the excavation and interpretation of the site.\n\nOverall, the discovery at Warratyi rock shelter is a major breakthrough in our understanding of human history in Australia, and highlights the importance of continued research and collaboration between archaeologists, Indigenous communities, and other stakeholders. \n\nNote: I have taken some liberties with the text to make it flow better and to condense the information into a one-page summary.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": " \nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, which will eventually leave all stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. Astrophysicist Dan Hooper proposed that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible, and use them to accelerate their civilization's growth. This would be done by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet. Hooper suggested that these civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars harvested. However, humans do not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and was later popularized by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\". Dyson realized that alien civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. He proposed that really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy.\n\nAstrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed in 1962 that very old and advanced civilizations would be of three types: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans might reach Type II in a few thousand years, and Type III in a few hundred thousand years.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, including in the novel \"Ringworld\" by Larry Niven and the TV show \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". However, the concept remains purely theoretical, and it is unclear whether advanced civilizations would actually be able to build such structures.\n\nIn conclusion, the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, and advanced civilizations may be able to capture stars from other galaxies to accelerate their growth. However, the detection of these civilizations remains a challenge, and it is unclear whether humans will be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars harvested.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Hooper took Cruz under her wing and began to mentor him, giving him small tasks to do in the classroom and eventually hiring him to do odd jobs around her house.\n\nAs Cruz spent more time with Hooper and her family, he began to open up and form a close bond with them. Hooper's husband, Gale, a firefighter, became a father figure to Cruz, and he eventually began to see Hooper as a mother figure. Cruz would often run to the Hoopers' house when he had a fight with his stepfather, and Hooper would take him in, providing him with a safe and loving environment.\n\nIn 1982, Cruz's stepfather physically abused him, and his mother called Hooper to ask if she could take Cruz in temporarily. Hooper agreed, and Cruz ended up staying with the Hoopers for the next 30 years. During that time, Cruz graduated from high school, attended Texas Tech University, and eventually got married. He and his wife, Anel, have two children, and Cruz has become a successful businessman.\n\nIn 1998, Cruz asked Hooper and her husband to adopt him, and they agreed.

He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather.

The law, which was passed by the Jamaican parliament, allows for the possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana, and cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises. The law also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe law is a significant victory for the Rastafarian community, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament. The law also paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.\n\nThe law does not mean that Jamaica is softening its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. National security minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe law is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and several states have legalized recreational use. Uruguay has also created a legal marijuana market, and Argentina has decriminalized personal possession of marijuana.\n\nThe law has been welcomed by cannabis crusaders, who see it as a big step in the right direction. However, there is still much work to be done to refine the details of the law and establish a functioning medical marijuana industry.\n\nThe law has significant implications for Jamaica's economy, particularly in the areas of health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items. Local scientists have already developed marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol\", which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients.\n\nOverall, the law is a significant step towards decriminalizing marijuana in Jamaica, and it has the potential to bring economic benefits and improve the lives of many Jamaicans.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It is a legal procedure that prevents the government from holding individuals indefinitely without showing cause. The Founders of the United States enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution, considering it a fundamental right that ensures the executive branch cannot hold people without cause. However, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, potentially allowing the government to detain individuals without legal recourse.\n\nThe MCA has eroded the foundation of the U.S. legal and constitutional framework, compromising the core legal value of habeas corpus. The government has little evidence against most Guantanamo detainees, with many being sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite legal victories affirming the detainees' right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts.\n\nIn a separate development, a New York judge has granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, potentially recognizing them as legal persons. The ruling could force the university to release the primates and sway additional judges to do the same with other research animals.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a major step forward in their efforts to secure the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals. While some experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, the group plans to use the habeas corpus ruling to sway judges in other jurisdictions and file additional cases involving other animals, including research animals.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of habeas corpus remains a crucial aspect of Western law, ensuring that individuals are not held indefinitely without cause. However, the MCA has compromised this right, and the government's treatment of Guantanamo detainees raises concerns about the erosion of this fundamental right. The recent ruling in the case of Hercules and Leo highlights the potential for animals to be recognized as legal persons and challenges the status quo of treating them as property.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

{"pred": " \nScientists have made significant discoveries about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once a warm and wet world with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, lasted for millions of years and was a major factor in the planet's habitability. The discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and finding that it contains a higher proportion of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, than Earth's ocean. This suggests that Mars lost a significant amount of water over time, equivalent to more than six times the amount of water now locked up in its polar ice caps.\n\nThe scientists used infrared maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that the planet lost a vast amount of water in the past. They calculated that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters. However, the ocean was likely not a complete cover, and the scientists believe it pooled into a deeper ocean in the low-lying northern hemisphere, covering nearly a fifth of the planet's surface.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The presence of a large ocean in the past suggests that the planet was habitable for a longer period than previously thought, and the conditions were likely suitable for life to emerge. The scientists believe that the ocean would have provided a habitable environment for a suitable duration for life to either originate or proliferate.\n\nThe study also suggests that the Martian atmosphere was once much thicker and more hospitable to life than it is today. The loss of water and the thinning of the atmosphere would have made the planet too cold for liquid water to exist, leading to the eventual receding of the ocean and the formation of the polar ice caps.\n\nThe discovery is a major breakthrough in our understanding of Mars' history and has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which is set to launch in 2018, will search for chemical signatures of life on Mars, and the discovery of a large ocean in the past suggests that the planet may have been habitable for a longer period than previously thought.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of a massive ocean on Mars in the past has significant implications for our understanding of the planet's history and its potential for supporting life.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

This unique event was the first time a university had been involved in a rescue operation of this kind. \n\nThe rescue operation was a result of Turner's determination to help her student and his family, who were facing a life-and-death situation.

{"pred": " \nThe European Court of Justice has ruled that Nestlé's trademark for the shape of the KitKat bar is invalid. The court found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive. The ruling sends the case back to the EU's trademark office, which must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark. The decision has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has also been featured in Britain's Brexit debate. Some supporters of cutting ties with the EU have suggested that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat. The ruling does not affect the brand name \"KitKat,\" only the shape of the bar. Nestlé has said that it believes the EU trademark office will side with the company and that the decision is not the end of the case. The company has spent over a decade fighting to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar, which has been a source of contention with rival Cadbury. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The ruling has implications for other chocolate companies, including Mondelez, which owns brands such as Cadbury and Toblerone. The company has won a trademark for the shape of Toblerone, but has lost a case against Nestlé over the shape of the KitKat bar. The case has also highlighted the complexities of trademark law in the EU, where companies must prove that their products are distinctive in every country where they operate. The ruling has been seen as a victory for Mondelez, which had argued that the shape of the KitKat bar was not distinctive enough to be trademarked. The case has also raised questions about the role of EU courts in protecting national brands and traditions. The ruling has been welcomed by some as a victory for consumer choice and competition, while others have seen it as a threat to the protection of national brands and traditions. The case is likely to continue to be closely followed by trademark lawyers and chocolate companies alike. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it is a bit longer than a standard page due to the complexity of the topic. \n\nAlso, I have taken some liberties with the summary to make it flow better and to include more information from the passages.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": " \nThe roar of the T. rex has been a staple of popular culture for decades, but new research suggests that the mighty dinosaur may not have been as loud as we think. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T. rex and other dinosaurs may have made sounds more similar to birds, such as pigeons or ostriches, rather than the loud roars depicted in movies and TV shows. The study found that dinosaurs may have used a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization, which involves making sounds through the skin in the neck rather than through the mouth. This type of vocalization is common in birds, particularly in large species such as ostriches and emus.\n\nThe study's authors used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptilian groups, and found that it has evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. They also found that only animals with relatively large body sizes, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. While we can't know for certain how dinosaurs sounded, the study suggests that they may have made sounds similar to those of modern birds, particularly during mating displays. This is a departure from the traditional image of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures, and suggests that they may have been more subtle and nuanced in their communication.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalization may have been influenced by body size, with larger animals being more likely to use this type of vocalization. This is because the inflation of the skin in the neck required to produce closed-mouth vocalization may be more challenging for smaller animals.\n\nThe study's findings are based on a collaboration between researchers from the University of Texas, Midwestern University, and the University of Utah, and were funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The study's authors hope that their research will contribute to a greater understanding of the evolution of bird vocalization and the behavior of dinosaurs.\n\nIn related news, sound designer Gary Rydstrom has spoken out about the creation of dinosaur sounds for the movie Jurassic Park. Rydstrom revealed that the iconic T. rex roar was created by combining the sounds of a baby elephant and a large animal eating, and that the velociraptor sounds were inspired by the calls of a bird.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on—except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time.

Suleiman also accused Mubarak's regime of corruption and vote rigging, and called for the harshest penalty against the former president.\n\nThe trial has been seen as a test of the country's commitment to accountability and justice.
