He then proposed to create more word-specific prototype HMMs to start training from, and to calculate the expected duration of the models to understand how they are training up. The discussion also touched on the idea of reducing the number of states for some of the shorter models to simplify the system, and comparing the performance of models with different numbers of states. PhD B also mentioned that Hynek suggested that in a real application, simpler models might be more suitable due to computational limitations. The plan for the next week is to continue working on these modifications and to try to establish a new baseline.

{"pred": " Kirsty Williams stated that there was still a job of work to do to understand and respond to the needs of teacher recruitment, with only 65% of priority places being filled in Welsh training centres. She attributed the issue to a global problem, citing a 40% drop in students training to be teachers in the USA, and emphasized that it was not just about money, as even England was struggling to recruit teachers despite higher financial incentives. She mentioned that they were taking a package of measures, including financial incentives, a national ITE recruitment marketing exercise, and an advisory board on recruitment and retention, to address the issue. She also highlighted the importance of diversity in the teaching workforce and the need to increase the number of career changers and people with different life experiences coming into teaching. Additionally, she mentioned that they were working on a part-time PGCE route to allow people to combine employment with teacher training, and that they were also looking at ways to support Welsh language skills among teachers. She acknowledged that there was a significant job of work to be done to reverse the decline in teacher recruitment, but emphasized that they were taking action to address the issue. She also mentioned that they were using a baseline of 2012-13 to project the increases in teacher recruitment, and that they were aware of the concerns about the University of South Wales and the impact of the merger on the Newport campus.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise. Kirsty Williams mentioned that this was not a unique issue in Wales, but a common issue across the globe. Money was not the only reason that prevented people from getting onto these courses.

{"pred": " The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display, with the Industrial Designer mentioning that it would increase the costs significantly, but the Marketing team thought it would also increase sales and make the product more desirable. The Project Manager suggested making two concepts, one with an LCD display and one without, to compare the costs and usability. The Industrial Designer mentioned that the advanced chip would be required for the LCD display, and the regular chip would be sufficient without it. The team decided to use a normal battery and a regular chip unless the LCD display is used, in which case an advanced chip would be required. The Industrial Designer was tasked with researching the costs of the advanced chip and the LCD display. The team also discussed the use of a joystick instead of a scroll button, which would be more expensive but potentially easier to use. The Project Manager emphasized the importance of keeping the design small and easy to use, and the Industrial Designer suggested using a hard plastic shape with rubber around it to make it more durable. The team agreed to have the design ready for the next meeting, with a detailed design concept.  The team also discussed the ease of use and the importance of making the product easy to use, but the Marketing team emphasized that selling the product was the top priority.
