Police had threatened to evict the protesters, but ultimately did not take action. In Los Angeles, police in riot gear closed in on Occupy protesters at City Hall on Monday morning, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. Four protesters were arrested during a brief confrontation. In both cities, the protesters have been peaceful and have been calling for economic justice and an end to corporate greed. The Los Angeles encampment, which has been tolerated by the city for weeks, has grown to over 400 tents and 700 people, with at least a third of the campers being homeless. The protesters have been joined by supporters from organized labor, clergy, and civil rights groups. The mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, has called for the protesters to move from the park and focus on spreading their message of economic justice. The protesters have been credited with showing restraint by the police, who have been praised for their handling of the situation. The Occupy movement has been a national phenomenon, with protests taking place in cities across the country. The movement has been met with a mix of support and resistance from local authorities, with some cities tolerating the protests and others cracking down on them. The movement's message of economic justice and an end to corporate greed has resonated with many Americans, who are frustrated with the current state of the economy and the influence of corporate power. The movement's future is uncertain, but it is clear that it has sparked a national conversation about economic inequality and the role of corporations in society. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not take a side in the conflict.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has also revealed that it can fuel the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the immune system, making it harder to kill. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the study found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, which means a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. When put into mice, the smoke-exposed MRSA showed a significant difference in mortality compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures.\n\nThe study suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also assists pathogens, making them more resistant to the immune system. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nIn a related study, researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a more potent inducer of bacterial resistance than e-cigarette vapor.\n\nOverall, the findings of these studies suggest that cigarette smoke is a significant contributor to the spread of MRSA and other superbugs, and that individuals who smoke are more susceptible to infectious diseases. The study's authors hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence that cigarette smoking is a major public health risk, and that individuals should refrain from smoking to protect their health. \n\nWord", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

According to Lumos, there are 8 million children worldwide who are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in atrocious conditions. The charity has been working to shed light on the lives of these children and to provide support to families who are struggling to care for their children.\n\nRowling recounts how she was inspired to start Lumos after seeing a photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. She was shocked by the conditions and the fact that the child was being held captive. She began writing letters to influential people and eventually established Lumos.\n\nThe charity has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. In Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos began working there. In the Czech Republic, there has been a 75% fall in admissions to institutions in Lumos's demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has reduced by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nRowling emphasizes that the solution to the problem of institutionalization is not to improve the conditions in institutions, but to eliminate them altogether. She argues that it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and that this also reduces long-term costs.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and Rowling is committed to making this a reality. She has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage people to get involved.\n\nRowling's message is clear: the institutionalization of children is a solvable problem, and it is up to all of us to make a difference.

The agreement comes after a unilateral operation by the US in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, which caused outrage in Pakistan. US Senator John Kerry visited Pakistan and met with Pakistani leaders to discuss the relationship between the two countries. Kerry said that the US and Pakistan will cooperate in operations against \"high-value targets\" in Pakistan and that the two countries will increase intelligence sharing and joint operations. Kerry also announced that Pakistan had agreed to return the tail of a US military helicopter that was damaged during the bin Laden raid. The handover of the helicopter tail is seen as a sign of goodwill and a step towards improving relations between the two countries. Kerry said that the relationship between the US and Pakistan is \"make-or-break\" and that actions, not words, will be critical in earning the votes of members of Congress who are skeptical of the relationship. The US and Pakistan have a complex relationship, with the US relying on Pakistan as a key supply route for troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan relying on US assistance to arm its military and shore up its economy. The relationship has been strained in recent months, with Pakistan passing a resolution condemning the bin Laden raid and threatening to cut off NATO supply routes through Pakistan. Kerry said that a continued downward spiral in US-Pakistan ties is a \"very dangerous road for everybody\" and that the two countries need to work together to address the threat of Islamist militancy.

The two women who carried out the attack, Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia, were arrested and are being held in Malaysia. North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, but Malaysia has accused the country of being responsible.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent is highly unusual and has raised concerns about public safety at the airport. The airport was not decontaminated for 11 days after the attack, and it is feared that the nerve agent may have contaminated the area.

The skeleton was discovered lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The team from the University of Reading, who made the discovery, will conduct scientific analysis to determine the gender of the child, its diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig in the Vale of Pewsey, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim of the dig is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nIn addition to the skeleton, the team has also uncovered several other significant finds, including flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. These finds were discovered at Marden henge, a prehistoric monument built in 2,400 BC and believed to be the largest of its kind in the country. The team has also discovered a rectangular building at Marden henge, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved buildings from the period ever found in the UK. The building is thought to have been used for gatherings and feasts, and the team has found evidence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe team is led by Dr Jim Leary, director of the excavation, who believes that Marden henge was used for status and to show off wealth and power. The site is vast, with ramparts three meters high and a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 meters tall. The team will continue to work on the site for years to come, and the public will have the opportunity to visit the site and see the finds on display.\n\nOverall, these discoveries are significant not only for the insights they provide into the lives of people who lived in the area thousands of years ago but also for the understanding of the prehistoric monuments and landscapes of the region.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now.

So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The legend, known as the Pishtacos, tells the story of mythical killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. According to Felix, the gang murdered up to 60 people and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, police in Lima, the capital, later admitted that the investigation had been botched and that there may have been only one victim. The police in Huanuco, where the alleged crimes took place, said that the four alleged killers may have bottled the victim's fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. The police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, with anthropologists saying that they foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Medical experts have also dismissed the theory that human fat has monetary value, saying that it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks. The case has also sparked concerns about the police's reputation and the impact on tourism in Peru. The police chief, Miguel Hidalgo, has apologized for the embarrassment caused by the case and has put Felix on indefinite leave from his job.

The PCTA has also seen a significant increase in long-distance hiking permits, with over 4,000 issued in 2016 alone. This has led to concerns about overcrowding and the potential for environmental damage.\n\nThe PCTA has implemented a quota system to manage the number of hikers on the trail, with a maximum of 50 permits per day. However, this has not been enough to prevent overcrowding, with many hikers reporting long lines and crowded campsites. The PCTA has also seen an increase in helicopter evacuations and searches, which can be costly and resource-intensive.\n\nSome hikers have expressed concerns about the impact of overcrowding on the trail and its environment. Desert ecosystems, in particular, are fragile and susceptible to damage from large numbers of hikers. The PCTA has implemented measures to mitigate this damage, including the creation of new campsites and the implementation of a “leave no trace” policy.\n\nDespite the challenges posed by overcrowding, many hikers continue to be drawn to the PCT. The trail offers a unique opportunity for challenge, change, and reconnection, and many hikers find it to be a transformative experience. However, it is clear that the PCT is facing a new reality, one in which the number of hikers is increasing rapidly and the trail is facing new challenges as a result.\n\nIn response to these challenges, the PCTA has launched a campaign called #WildResponsibly, which aims to promote safe and responsible hiking practices. The campaign encourages hikers to follow the principles of “leave no trace” and to respect the trail and its environment.\n\nOverall, the PCT is facing a new era of popularity, one that brings both opportunities and challenges. As the number of hikers continues to grow, it is clear that the PCTA and the hiking community will need to work together to ensure that the trail remains a safe and sustainable destination for hikers of all levels.\n\nThe PCT is a 2,650-mile trail that stretches from the Mexican border to the Canadian border, passing through California, Oregon, and Washington.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The most striking feature of Caihong juji is its iridescent feathers, which are similar to those found in modern hummingbirds. The feathers on its head, chest, and tail are predicted to have shimmered with colors of the rainbow, making it one of the most colorful dinosaurs to have ever existed.\n\nCaihong juji had a bird-like body, with feathers that were likely used for flight. However, it also had a distinctive crest on its head, similar to that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur's tail was long and frond-like, with asymmetrical feathers that would have borne the aerodynamic load of flight. This makes Caihong juji the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has provided new insights into the evolution of feathers and their use in dinosaurs. It is believed that feathers originally evolved for display purposes, and later took on the traits necessary for flight. The discovery of Caihong juji's iridescent feathers suggests that some dinosaurs may have used their feathers for social or sexual displays, rather than just for flight.\n\nThe fossil of Caihong juji was discovered in 2014 by a local farmer in northeastern China.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The couple had decided not to climb to the summit due to the approaching dusk, and instead attempted to traverse the west face of the mountain. However, Jane fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff and then tumbled 150 meters down into a rocky area. The coroner recorded a conclusion of accidental death.\n\nThe incident highlights the risks of relying solely on electronic navigation aids, such as smartphone apps, when navigating the outdoors. Experts have warned that these apps can be unreliable, especially in areas with limited cell phone reception or when the battery is running low. They recommend carrying a paper map and compass as a backup, and to always be aware of the terrain and potential hazards.\n\nThe Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team was called to the scene and led Gary Wilson to safety, but unfortunately, they were unable to recover Jane's body until two days later. The team's leader, Detective Constable Tim Bird, said that the couple's decision to traverse the west face was an attempt to avoid the summit, but it was not a safe route. He also noted that the light boots worn by Jane were not suitable for the rough terrain.\n\nJane Wilson was a fit and active woman who had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sweetened beverages, was implemented to reduce sugar consumption and raise revenue for community programs. However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and that it will drive business out of the city.\n\nAccording to Costco, a case of Gatorade now costs over $26, a 64% increase from the previous price. The company has posted signs directing customers to its stores outside of Seattle to avoid the tax. Other retailers, such as Starbucks, have also been affected by the tax, with some customers opting to buy their drinks outside of the city.\n\nThe tax has been a contentious issue, with some arguing that it is a necessary measure to promote public health, while others see it as an overreach of government power. A study by the Tax Foundation found that the tax will disproportionately affect low-income families, who spend a larger portion of their income on food and beverages.\n\nIn Cook County, Illinois, a similar sweetened beverage tax was repealed in December 2017, just two months after it went into effect.

That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were more likely to have children with ADHD-like behaviors. However, the study's authors emphasized that the findings do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that while the findings are concerning, they should not cause pregnant women to panic. \"We're not saying that if you take one Tylenol, your child will have ADHD,\" she said. \"But if you're taking it frequently, you might want to think about alternatives.\"\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has suggested a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD. However, other experts have pointed out that the study's results are not conclusive and that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe American Medical Association has emphasized that the study's findings do not mean that pregnant women should avoid taking acetaminophen altogether. However, they do suggest that women may want to consider alternative pain relief options, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture, rather than relying on medication.\n\nThe study's authors also noted that the data suggests that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy is associated with higher risks. When women reported taking acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more, their children had a 50% increased risk of receiving ADHD medication.\n\nThe manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has stated that the study's findings are not conclusive and that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the importance of carefully considering the potential risks and benefits of taking acetaminophen during pregnancy.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The mission is named after astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who predicted the existence of solar wind in the 1950s. The spacecraft will be launched in July 2018 and will travel to the sun, coming within 3.9 million miles of the sun's surface. The spacecraft will be equipped with a heat shield to protect it from the intense heat of the sun and will study the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun. The mission will help scientists understand the sun's behavior and improve their ability to predict space weather. The spacecraft will also study the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows away from the sun. The mission is expected to provide new insights into the sun's behavior and will help scientists better understand the sun's impact on the Earth's magnetic field and climate. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to visit the sun and will provide a unique opportunity for scientists to study the sun up close. The mission is a major milestone in the study of the sun and will help scientists better understand the sun's behavior and its impact on the Earth. The spacecraft will be equipped with four instruments to study the sun's corona, the solar wind, and the sun's magnetic field. The instruments will measure the temperature, density, and composition of the solar wind, as well as the sun's magnetic field. The mission will also study the sun's corona, which is the outer atmosphere of the sun. The corona is much hotter than the sun's surface and is thought to be the source of the solar wind.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}
{"pred": " \nThe recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have raised concerns about the security of customer information. According to reports, Neiman Marcus was hacked as far back as July, but the breach was not fully contained until January 1st. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner and has offered customers one free year of credit monitoring.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target was also hacked, resulting in the theft of credit and debit card data for over 100 million customers. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for millions of customers. The report details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.\n\nThe report suggests that the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it, unencrypted. The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\"\n\nThe report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach. The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches.\n\nThe report also suggests that the data breach was part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and other personal information belonging to 70 million people. The authorities are still investigating the source of the attack, but it is believed to have originated from Eastern Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have highlighted the need for retailers to improve their security measures to protect customer information. The use of malware and other sophisticated hacking techniques has made it easier for cyber crooks to steal sensitive information, and it is likely that we will see more of this type of breach in the future.

Nairobi National Park, where the lion escaped, is home to a large population of wildlife, including lions, leopards, and giraffes. However, the park is also surrounded by urban development, and the increasing noise and disturbance from human activity is believed to be contributing to the lions' escape.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from a national park in South Africa and is currently being hunted by wildlife officials. The officials have vowed to put the lion down once they capture it, but conservationists are calling for the lion to be saved and relocated.\n\nThe incidents have highlighted the challenges of managing wildlife in the face of urbanization and human activity. While the rangers' decision to shoot the lion was made in the interests of public safety, it has also sparked a wider debate about the value of wildlife and the need for more effective conservation efforts.\n\nThe African lion is considered a vulnerable species, with its population declining by 50% over the past two decades.

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nA new study suggests that rapidly losing and regaining weight, or “yo-yo” dieting, may increase the risk for deadly heart attacks and strokes in people with coronary artery disease. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest changes in body weight had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those who experienced the smallest body weight changes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that it's essential to lose weight, but it's also crucial to keep it off. He suggests that the findings may be used as motivation to keep the weight off. The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCoronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to angina or heart attack.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. The researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with coronary heart disease and suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

Younger patients also had higher five-year survival rates compared to older patients.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized that the findings are a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community to recognize the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger individuals. She noted that doctors should be more vigilant in screening for warning signs of colon cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits.\n\nThe study's results raise questions about whether current screening guidelines should be revised to start at a younger age. Currently, guidelines recommend screening for colon cancer at age 50. However, Dr. Hendren suggested that individuals with a family history of colon cancer or other risk factors may benefit from earlier screening.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons behind the increasing incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals are unclear. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, speculated that environmental factors, such as a poor diet and lack of physical activity, may contribute to the trend.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in screening for colon cancer, particularly among younger individuals. While the exact reasons for the trend are unclear, the findings suggest that younger patients may benefit from more aggressive treatment and earlier screening. Further research is needed to determine the optimal age for screening and to understand the underlying causes of the increasing incidence of colon cancer in younger individuals. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not include any personal opinions or biases.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, is located in the Flinders Ranges and contains a treasure trove of artefacts, including stone tools, bone tools, and ochre. The discovery pushes back the known timeline of human settlement in the region by at least 10,000 years and suggests that humans were able to adapt to the harsh desert environment much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe site was discovered by chance by archaeologist Giles Hamm, who was surveying the area with local Aboriginal elders. Hamm and his team have been excavating the site for several years and have uncovered a range of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, stone tools, and ochre. The artefacts have been dated using a range of techniques, including optical dating and radiocarbon dating, and have been found to be between 49,000 and 46,000 years old.\n\nThe discovery is significant not only because of its age but also because it provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the giant wombat-like Diprotodon and the giant bird Genyornis. The presence of these animals at the site suggests that humans were able to hunt and gather in the region much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe discovery also challenges the idea that humans were unable to adapt to the harsh desert environment of central Australia. Instead, it suggests that humans were able to thrive in the region and develop complex technologies and social systems.\n\nThe discovery has been published in the journal Nature and has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological finds in Australian history. It is expected to have a major impact on our understanding of human history in Australia and will likely be the subject of much debate and discussion among archaeologists and historians.\n\nIn related news, a recent study published in the journal Nature has found that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia around 49,000 years ago, 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The movie is based on real events, but it also takes some creative liberties to enhance the storytelling.\n\nThe film opens with a semi-animated sequence that explains the mass migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North, which contributed to the racial tensions in Detroit. The story then follows a group of young black men, including Larry Reed, a singer with the group The Dramatics, who are caught up in the riots and eventually taken to the Algiers Motel.\n\nThe film's centerpiece is the police occupation of the Algiers Motel, where the officers use torture and intimidation to extract confessions from the suspects. The scenes are graphic and disturbing, and the film's use of handheld camera work and natural lighting creates a sense of immediacy and realism.\n\nThe film also explores the role of the National Guard and the Michigan State Police in the riots, and the ways in which they contributed to the violence and chaos. The movie's climax is the trial of the three police officers involved in the incident, which is a tense and dramatic sequence.\n\nDetroit has received widespread critical acclaim, with many praising the film's visceral and unflinching portrayal of police brutality and racism.

Astrophysicist Dan Hooper has proposed a new twist on the Kardashev scale, which measures the energy consumption of technologically advanced civilizations. According to Hooper, the only way for a civilization to prevent being left behind is to harvest energy from distant stars before they become inaccessible. This can be achieved by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which can collect and beam back energy from the star. Hooper suggests that advanced civilizations may already be doing this, and that we may be able to detect their presence by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and has since been explored in science fiction. Dyson realized that advanced civilizations could be recognized by their waste heat, which would be detectable as infrared radiation. He proposed that really advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy.\n\nThe Kardashev scale, proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962, categorizes civilizations into three types based on their energy consumption: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. According to Kardashev, a Type III civilization would be able to harness the energy of an entire galaxy, and would likely be able to detect and communicate with other civilizations.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres and other mega-structures has been explored in science fiction, including in the works of authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven. These structures are often depicted as massive, spherical shells that surround a star and collect its energy. In reality, Dyson spheres would likely be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, known as statites, which would hover in space and collect energy from the star.\n\nOverall, the idea of Dyson spheres and the Kardashev scale provides a framework for understanding the potential for advanced civilizations to harness energy from distant stars and communicate with each other. While we are still far from achieving this level of technological advancement, the idea of Dyson spheres and the Kardashev scale serves as a reminder of", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Excavations at the Olorgesailie Basin have uncovered evidence of toolmaking and trading networks dating back to around 320,000 years ago. The findings suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environments and develop complex social networks, which may have played a key role in their survival.\n\nThe discoveries include the oldest known evidence of toolmaking, with tools made from obsidian and other materials found to have been transported from as far as 25 miles away. The tools themselves are smaller and more sophisticated than those found in earlier deposits, suggesting a significant technological advance.\n\nThe researchers also found evidence of the use of red ochre pigment, which was likely used for symbolic purposes. This is the earliest known evidence of the use of pigment for symbolic purposes, and suggests that early humans had a level of cognitive sophistication that was previously thought to be unique to modern humans.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that is often thought to have occurred around 40,000-50,000 years ago may have been a gradual process that began much earlier.\n\nThe researchers believe that the ability of early humans to adapt to changing environments and develop complex social networks was key to their survival. This ability allowed them to migrate to new areas, trade with other groups, and develop new technologies.\n\nThe discoveries also suggest that the development of modern human behavior was not unique to Homo sapiens, but was a process that occurred in multiple human species over time. This challenges the traditional view of human evolution, which holds that modern humans emerged in Africa around 200,000 years ago and then migrated to other parts of the world.\n\nOverall, the findings from the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new perspective on the evolution of human behavior and technology, and highlight the complexity and sophistication of early human societies. They suggest that the development of modern human behavior was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years, and that early humans were capable of complex thought and behavior long before the emergence of Homo sapiens. \n\nThe discoveries also have implications for our understanding of the relationship between climate change and human evolution. The researchers suggest that the changing climate may have driven the development of new technologies and social networks, and that early humans were able to adapt to these changes in order to survive.\n\nIn conclusion, the findings from the Olorgesailie Basin provide a new and exciting perspective on the evolution of", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

If granted parole, Simpson could be released as early as October 1, 2019.\n\nSimpson's parole hearing comes more than two decades after his highly publicized acquittal in the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, in 1994. The acquittal sparked widespread outrage and protests, particularly among the African American community, who felt that Simpson had received preferential treatment due to his celebrity status.\n\nIn 1997, Simpson was found liable for the murders in a civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages to the victims' families. Simpson has maintained his innocence in the murders, but has acknowledged that he was involved in the armed robbery and kidnapping that led to his current incarceration.\n\nSimpson's lawyer, Yale Galanter, has stated that his client has been a model prisoner and has expressed remorse for his actions. Simpson has also spoken publicly about the incident, stating that he was trying to recover stolen property and that he regrets his involvement in the botched heist.\n\nThe Nevada Parole Board will consider Simpson's request for parole, as well as his behavior while incarcerated, his risk to the community, and any letters of support or opposition from the public. If granted parole, Simpson will be released from prison and will be subject to supervision by the Nevada Department of Corrections.\n\nSimpson's release from prison would be a significant development in a case that has captivated the nation for decades. It remains to be seen whether the Parole Board will grant Simpson's request, but one thing is certain: the outcome will be closely watched by the public and the media.\n\nIn related news, Simpson's net worth has been estimated to be around $3.2 million, which he will be able to access once he is released from prison. Simpson's NFL pension and other assets will also be available to him upon his release.\n\nThe media has been covering the story extensively, with many outlets speculating about Simpson's chances of being", "answers": ["OJ Simpson's parole hearing in Nevada will be broadcast live at 1pm EDT Thursday and there's a strong chance that his path to freedom will be clear by the end of the afternoon. Nobody has registered to testify against the 70-year-old Simpson, who has been in prison for nine years on 12 convictions related to a Las Vegas robbery and will appear before the Nevada Parole Board via videolink, NPR reports. Thursday's hearing will cover four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Four board members will vote after the hearing and Simpson could be free by Oct. 1 if they are all in favor of parole. If Simpson is indeed released this fall—which appears almost certainly to be the decision—it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports. He will still receive an NFL pension estimated at $25,000 per month."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3982}

The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe law is a significant step forward for Jamaica, which has a long history of marijuana use and has been a major supplier of the drug to the US and other Caribbean islands. The law also paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.\n\nThe law has been welcomed by many, including Rastafarians, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament. The law also has the potential to bring in revenue for Jamaica, which is currently struggling with its economy.\n\nThe law does not mean that Jamaica is softening its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The national security minister, Peter Bunting, has stated that the security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe law is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and several countries, including Uruguay and Argentina, have also relaxed their laws on marijuana.\n\nThe law will need to be refined in the coming months, but it is a significant step forward for Jamaica and has the potential to bring in revenue and improve the lives of many Jamaicans.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Jamaica has passed a law that reduces possession of small quantities of marijuana to a petty offence\n* The law makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6g) of marijuana a non-arrestable offence that can result in a fine\n* The law permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes\n* The law paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp\n* The law does not mean that Jamaica is softening its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots\n* The law is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use.

The search for the wreckage and the bodies of the victims has been ongoing for nearly a week. On Saturday, Indonesian officials announced that they had found four large objects on the ocean floor, believed to be parts of the plane. The objects were detected using sonar equipment and were found in the target search area. The largest object, measuring 18 meters (59 feet) long and 4 meters (13 feet) wide, is believed to be part of the plane's body. Other debris, including chunks of metal and a backpack with food and a camera, have also been found.\n\nThe discovery of the wreckage is a significant breakthrough in the investigation into the crash. The plane's black boxes, which contain the flight data and cockpit voice recorders, have not yet been located, but the discovery of the wreckage will help investigators to piece together the events leading up to the crash.\n\nThe cause of the crash is still unknown, but bad weather is believed to have played a role. The plane was flying from Surabaya, Indonesia, to Singapore when it encountered intense thunderstorms and turbulence. The pilot had asked to climb to a higher altitude to avoid the bad weather, but was denied permission by air traffic control.\n\nThe search for the wreckage has been hampered by strong currents and high waves, which have scattered debris and bodies in all directions. So far, only 30 bodies have been recovered, and many are still missing. The Indonesian authorities have announced that they will conduct autopsies on some of the bodies, including those of the pilot and co-pilot, to determine the cause of death.\n\nThe crash has raised questions about the safety of low-cost airlines and the role of weather in aviation accidents. AirAsia, which is a popular low-cost carrier in Southeast Asia, has been criticized for its safety record. The airline has suspended flights from Surabaya to Singapore pending the outcome of the investigation.\n\nThe search for the wreckage and the bodies of the victims is ongoing, with a second U.S. Navy ship arriving on Saturday to assist in the search. The Indonesian authorities are hopeful that the body of the plane will still be largely intact, which will speed up the investigation.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It is a legal procedure that prevents the government from holding individuals indefinitely without showing cause. The Founders of the United States enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution, considering it a fundamental right that ensures the executive branch cannot hold people without cause. However, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, potentially allowing the government to detain individuals without legal recourse.\n\nThe MCA has eroded the foundation of the U.S. legal and constitutional framework, compromising the core legal value of habeas corpus. The government has little evidence against most Guantanamo detainees, with many being sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite legal victories affirming the detainees' right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts.\n\nIn a separate development, a New York judge has granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, potentially recognizing them as legal persons. The ruling could force the university to release the primates and sway other judges to do the same with other research animals.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a major step forward in their efforts to secure the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals. While some experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, the group plans to use it to sway judges in other jurisdictions and file additional cases involving other animals. The case highlights the tension between the rights of individuals and the interests of the government, raising questions about the limits of executive power and the definition of personhood. \n\nIn conclusion, the concept of habeas corpus remains a vital aspect of Western law, ensuring that individuals are not held indefinitely without cause.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science. The case kicked off in December 2013 with lawsuits that also included two chimps held on private property; each case was struck down, sending the NhRP down the appeals path. Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.
