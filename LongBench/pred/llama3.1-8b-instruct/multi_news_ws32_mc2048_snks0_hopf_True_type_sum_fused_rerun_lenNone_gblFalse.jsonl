During this time, paramedics waited 150 yards away because police had not declared the terminal safe to enter. It was not until 9:58 a.m. that airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. Hernandez was pronounced dead at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, despite efforts by doctors to revive him.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the coordination between police and fire officials, with some officials suggesting that a lack of coordination may have prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has also revealed that it can fuel the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the immune system, making it harder to kill. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the study found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, which means a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. When put into mice, the smoke-exposed MRSA showed a significant difference in mortality compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures.\n\nThe study suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also assists pathogens, making them more resistant to the immune system. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nIt is worth noting that a previous study conducted by the same researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a significant contributor to the increased resistance of MRSA, and that individuals should refrain from smoking to reduce the risk of MRSA infections.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the dangers of cigarette smoke and its impact on the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. The findings of this study have significant implications for public health, and emphasize the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of MRSA infections. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote:", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The policy states that while the TV will not collect users’ spoken words, it may still collect associated texts and other data. Users can opt out of the feature by disabling voice recognition, but this will prevent them from using voice commands to control the TV.\n\nMicrosoft’s new Xbox console also features an always-on listening mode, which allows users to control the console with voice commands, even when it is turned off. The Kinect peripheral, which is included with the console, can read users’ heartbeats and recognize individual voices. While Microsoft claims that the Kinect is not recording users, but rather listening for specific cues, such as the command “Xbox on,” the feature has raised concerns about privacy and the potential for malicious actors to access users’ data.\n\nBoth companies have defended their features, stating that they are designed to provide users with a more convenient and personalized experience. However, critics have pointed out that the features raise concerns about the potential for companies to collect and use users’ data without their consent.

According to Lumos, there are 8 million children worldwide who are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in atrocious conditions. The charity has been working to shed light on the lives of these children and to provide support to families who are struggling to care for their children.\n\nRowling recounts how she was inspired to start Lumos after seeing a photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. She was shocked by the conditions and the fact that the child was being held captive. She began writing letters to influential people and eventually established Lumos.\n\nThe charity has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. In Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos began working there. In the Czech Republic, there has been a 75% fall in admissions to institutions in Lumos's demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has reduced by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nRowling emphasizes that the solution to the problem of institutionalization is not to improve the conditions in institutions, but to eliminate them altogether. She argues that it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and that this also reduces long-term costs.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and Rowling is committed to making this a reality. She has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage people to get involved.\n\nRowling's message is clear: the institutionalization of children is a solvable problem, and it is up to all of us to make a difference.

The skeleton was discovered lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The team from the University of Reading, who made the discovery, will conduct scientific analysis to determine the gender of the child, its diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig in the Vale of Pewsey, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim of the dig is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nIn addition to the skeleton, the team has also uncovered several other significant finds, including flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. These finds were discovered at Marden henge, a prehistoric monument built in 2,400 BC and believed to be the largest of its kind in the country. The team has also discovered a rectangular building at Marden henge, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved buildings from the period ever found in the UK. The building is thought to have been used for gatherings and feasts, and the team has found evidence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe team is led by Dr Jim Leary, director of the excavation, who believes that Marden henge was used for status and to show off wealth and power. The site is vast, with ramparts three meters high and a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 meters tall. The team will continue to work on the site for years to come, and the public will have the opportunity to visit the site and see the finds on display.\n\nOverall, these discoveries are significant not only for the insights they provide into the lives of people who lived in the area thousands of years ago but also for the understanding of the prehistoric monuments and landscapes of the region.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now.

Despite the opposition, the company's board defended the pay package, saying it was based on Dudley's exceptional performance in 2015.\n\nHowever, the shareholders were not convinced, and a majority of them voted against the pay package at the company's annual general meeting. The vote was non-binding, but it was seen as a significant rebuke to the company's board and Dudley. The shareholders' opposition was led by several major institutional investors, including Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management.\n\nThe opposition to Dudley's pay package was not just about the amount of money he received, but also about the fact that it was awarded at a time when the company was facing significant financial challenges. The company's loss in 2015 was its worst ever, and it has since announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs and slash its dividend.\n\nThe shareholders' vote was seen as a significant moment in the debate over executive pay in the UK.

The legend, known as the Pishtacos, tells the story of mythical killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. According to Felix, the gang murdered up to 60 people and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, police in Lima, the capital, later admitted that the investigation had been botched and that there may have been only one victim. The police in Huanuco, where the alleged crimes took place, said that the four alleged killers may have bottled the victim's fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. The police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, with anthropologists saying that they foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Medical experts have also dismissed the theory that human fat has monetary value, saying that it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks. The case has also sparked concerns about the police's reputation and the impact on tourism in Peru. The police chief, Miguel Hidalgo, has apologized for the embarrassment caused by the case and has put Felix on indefinite leave from his job.

The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has reported a 300% increase in website traffic and a 50% increase in requests for permits. The PCTA has also seen an increase in the number of hikers attempting to complete the entire trail, with over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits issued in 2016.\n\nHowever, this increase in hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment. The PCTA has implemented a quota system, limiting the number of hikers to 50 per day, in an effort to mitigate the wear and tear on the trail and protect the fragile desert ecosystems. Despite this, many hikers are still reporting crowded conditions, with some sections of the trail seeing up to 3,000 hikers in a short period of time.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has also put a strain on essential services, such as helicopter evacuations and searches. In the first 50 miles of the trail, there have already been 20 rescues in 2016. The PCTA is working to promote responsible hiking practices and has launched a campaign called #responsiblywild, which encourages hikers to follow the principles of leave-no-trace and to respect the environment.\n\nSome hikers are expressing concerns about the impact of overcrowding on the trail experience, with some reporting that the crowds are detracting from the sense of solitude and connection with nature that the PCT is known for. Others are worried about the potential for accidents and injuries due to the increased number of hikers on the trail.\n\nDespite these concerns, the PCT remains a popular destination for hikers, and the PCTA is working to balance the needs of hikers with the need to protect the environment. The association is also promoting alternative hiking options, such as section hiking and day hiking, which can help to reduce the impact on the trail and the environment.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, another hiking trail, the Appalachian Trail, is also seeing an increase in popularity, with the release of a new movie, “A Walk in the Woods,” starring Robert Redford and Nick Nolte.

Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

Wright's death was announced by her literary agents, who stated that she had been ill for several months.\n\nBorn in 1947, Wright grew up in a wealthy family in London and was the youngest of four children. Her father, a surgeon, was an abusive and alcoholic man who struggled with addiction. Wright's early life was marked by a privileged upbringing, but she also experienced a tumultuous relationship with her father, which would later influence her writing and cooking.\n\nWright's career in law was cut short due to her struggles with alcoholism, which she wrote about in her autobiography, Spilling the Beans. She eventually turned to cooking and became a successful chef, running her own catering business and working in private households. Wright's passion for food and cooking led her to become a prominent figure in the culinary world, and she went on to write several books on food and cooking.\n\nIn addition to her work as a chef and food historian, Wright was also a television personality, appearing on various shows, including Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, as well as her own solo series, Clarissa and the Country. Wright was known for her outspoken views on food, politics, and rural life, and was a vocal supporter of hunting and the Countryside Alliance.\n\nWright's personal life was marked by struggles with addiction and financial difficulties, which she wrote about in her autobiography. She never married but had a long-term relationship with a man named Clive, who died in 1982. Wright was declared bankrupt several times due to her financial struggles.\n\nThroughout her life, Wright was known for her intelligence, wit, and strong opinions, which made her a beloved figure in the culinary world.

The couple had decided not to climb to the summit due to the approaching dusk, and instead attempted to traverse the west face of the mountain. However, Jane fell 20-30 feet down a vertical cliff and then tumbled 150 meters down into a rocky area.

The team's leader, Detective Constable Tim Bird, said that the couple's decision to traverse the west face was an attempt to avoid the summit, but it was not a safe route. He also noted that the light boots worn by Jane were not suitable for the rough terrain.\n\nJane Wilson was a fit and active woman who had been mountain walking and scrambling for six years.

The tax, which adds 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sweetened drinks, has been touted as a way to reduce sugar consumption and improve public health. However, many residents and business owners are speaking out against the tax, citing its regressive nature and the negative impact it will have on low-income families.\n\nOne of the most vocal critics of the tax is Costco, which has posted signs directing customers to its stores outside of Seattle to avoid the tax. The company has also increased the price of its drinks by 64 cents per gallon to account for the tax. Other retailers, such as Starbucks, have also been affected by the tax, with some locations posting signs indicating that the tax will be passed on to customers.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of exemptions for certain types of sweetened drinks, such as those sold at Starbucks. This has led to accusations that the tax is unfairly targeting low-income families, who are more likely to purchase sweetened drinks at convenience stores and other retailers.\n\nIn addition to the criticism from residents and business owners, the tax has also been met with opposition from lawmakers in other parts of the state. A bill has been introduced in the Washington state legislature to repeal the tax, citing concerns about its impact on local businesses and the economy.\n\nThe tax has also been compared to a similar tax implemented in Cook County, Illinois, which was repealed after just two months due to widespread opposition. The tax in Cook County added 1.75 cents per ounce to the price of sweetened drinks, and was met with fierce resistance from retailers and consumers.\n\nDespite the criticism, supporters of the tax argue that it is a necessary step to reduce sugar consumption and improve public health. They point to studies that show a link between sugary drink consumption and obesity, diabetes, and other health problems. However, opponents of the tax argue that it is a regressive tax that will disproportionately affect low-income families and small businesses.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of transparency and accountability. Some critics have argued that the tax is a form of \"nanny statism,\" in which the government is attempting to dictate what citizens can and cannot consume. Others have argued that the tax is a form of \"taxation without representation,\" in which citizens are being taxed without having a say in how the revenue is spent.\n\nOverall, the sweetened beverage tax in Seattle", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were associated with higher risks of ADHD-like behaviors in their children.\n\nThe study's authors, led by Dr. Beate Ritz of the University of California, Los Angeles, found that women who reported taking acetaminophen for 20 weeks or more had a 50% increased risk of their children being prescribed ADHD medication. However, the study's authors emphasized that the results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns among experts, who are urging pregnant women to be cautious when taking acetaminophen. Dr. Ritz advised pregnant women to try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more research is done. Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist, noted that the study highlights the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted and that there are nonpharmacological ways to deal with pain, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, Dr. Wiznitzer pointed out that the study's findings are not conclusive and that there are many variables that need to be considered, such as the fact that ADHD runs in families.\n\nThe manufacturer of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, has responded to the study by stating that acetaminophen has a favorable safety profile when used as directed and that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nIn conclusion, while the study's findings are concerning, they do not provide conclusive evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD. Pregnant women are advised to be cautious when taking acetaminophen and to consider alternative methods for managing pain.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}
{"pred": " \nThe recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have raised concerns about the security of customer information. According to reports, Neiman Marcus was hacked as far back as July, but the breach was not fully contained until January 1st. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner and has offered customers one free year of credit monitoring.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target was also hacked, resulting in the theft of credit and debit card data for over 100 million customers. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for millions of customers. The report details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.\n\nThe report suggests that the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it, unencrypted. The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\"\n\nThe report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach. The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches.\n\nThe report also suggests that the data breach was part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and other personal information belonging to 70 million people. The authorities are still investigating the source of the attack, but it is believed to have originated from Eastern Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have highlighted the need for retailers to improve their security measures to protect customer information. The use of malware and other sophisticated hacking techniques has made it easier for cyber crooks to steal sensitive information, and it is likely that we will see more of this type of breach in the future.

The Journal shares this feature by way of example: The virus focused on stealing data during the peak hours of 10am and 5pm; the data was housed in a Target server that the hackers later accessed.

The lion had escaped from Nairobi National Park, where he was a popular tourist attraction, and was surrounded by hundreds of people who were trying to take selfies with him. The rangers claimed that they had no choice but to shoot the lion as he posed an immediate threat to human life.\n\nHowever, many Kenyans have expressed outrage over the killing of Mohawk, with some calling for an investigation into the incident. The hashtag #JusticeforMohawk has been trending on social media, with many people questioning why the rangers did not try to tranquilize the lion instead of killing him.\n\nThe incident has also raised concerns about the safety of wildlife in Kenya's national parks, which are facing increasing pressure from urban development and human-wildlife conflict. Nairobi National Park, where Mohawk was killed, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country, but it is also facing encroachment by developers and is home to a growing human population.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park in South Africa and is currently being hunted by wildlife officials. The lion, who has escaped from the park before, is considered a threat to human life and is likely to be killed if caught.\n\nThe incidents have highlighted the challenges faced by wildlife conservationists in protecting lions and other endangered species in Africa. Habitat loss, human-wildlife conflict, and poaching are all major threats to lion populations, which have declined by 50% over the past two decades.\n\nIn Kenya, the government has promised to take steps to protect the country's wildlife, including improving the fencing of national parks and increasing the number of wildlife rangers.

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nA new study suggests that rapidly losing and regaining weight, or “yo-yo” dieting, may increase the risk for deadly heart attacks and strokes in people with coronary artery disease. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest changes in body weight had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those who experienced the smallest body weight changes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that it's essential to lose weight, but it's also crucial to keep it off. He suggests that the findings may be used as motivation to keep the weight off. The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCoronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to angina or heart attack.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. The researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with coronary heart disease and suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise.

According to a recent study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This trend is raising concerns among medical professionals, who are urging the medical community to be more vigilant in screening for the disease in younger patients. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, but they also tended to live longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment. The researchers believe that this finding suggests the need for improved risk assessment and screening for younger adults. They also recommend that doctors be more aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, and changes in bowel habits. \n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, notes that colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly, but this study is a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community that a significant number of cases are occurring in younger people. She emphasizes that doctors should be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer in younger patients and consider screening them earlier than the recommended age of 50, especially if they have a family history of the disease. \n\nHowever, not all experts agree that screening guidelines should be changed to start at a younger age. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, notes that the reasons for the increase in colon cancer among younger adults are not yet clear and that it may be related to environmental factors such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. He also points out that the risk of colon cancer is still relatively low in younger individuals, and that expanding screening to younger age groups may not be necessary at this time. \n\nOverall, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in screening for colorectal cancer in younger patients. While the exact causes of the trend are still unclear, the researchers believe that their findings have important implications for the medical community and for individuals at risk of developing the disease. \n\nKey statistics:\n\n* One in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50\n* Younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer\n* Younger patients tend to live longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment\n* 15% of colon cancer patients are under the", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": " \nArchaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, uncovering evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years. The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has yielded a treasure trove of artefacts, including stone tools, ochre, and burnt eggshells, which have been dated using a combination of optical and radiocarbon dating methods. The findings suggest that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia at least 10,000 years earlier than previously thought, and that they were able to adapt to the harsh environment and develop sophisticated technologies.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by Giles Hamm, a consultant archaeologist from La Trobe University, who has been working with the Adnyamathanha people, the traditional owners of the land, for over a decade. Hamm and his team have been excavating the site since 2011, and their findings have been published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe artefacts found at the site include some of the oldest known examples of stone tools in Australia, as well as evidence of the use of ochre, a pigment made from iron oxide, which was used for a variety of purposes, including body painting and ritual ceremonies. The team also found burnt eggshells, which suggest that humans were cooking and consuming eggs, a practice that is still observed by some Indigenous Australian communities today.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of the history of human settlement in Australia, and challenges the long-held assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative or technologically advanced as other cultures. The findings also suggest that humans were able to adapt to the harsh environment of the arid interior of Australia, and develop sophisticated technologies that allowed them to thrive in this environment.\n\nThe Warratyi rock shelter site is located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, and is considered one of the most important archaeological sites in Australia. The site has been dated to between 49,000 and 44,000 years ago, and the artefacts found there provide a unique window into the lives of the earliest Australians.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of archaeology, and has been praised by experts for its significance and importance. The findings have also been welcomed by the Adnyamathanha people, who have been working with the researchers to protect and preserve the site.\n\nIn related news, a recent study published in the journal Nature has found that humans arrived in the arid", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": " \nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, which will eventually leave all stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. Astrophysicist Dan Hooper proposed that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible, and use them to accelerate their civilization's growth. This would be done by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet. Hooper suggested that these civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars harvested. However, humans do not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and was later popularized by science fiction authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven. Dyson spheres are hypothetical megastructures that would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, which would hover around a star and collect its energy. These structures would be detectable as infrared radiation, and would be a sign of an advanced civilization.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres is not just a science fiction concept, but has been proposed as a way to search for advanced alien civilizations. Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed that advanced civilizations would be of three types: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans are currently at a 0.7 on the Kardashev scale, and would need to reach Type II in a few thousand years and Type III in a few hundred thousand years to be considered advanced civilizations.\n\nThe search for advanced alien civilizations is an ongoing effort, and scientists are using various methods to detect signs of life beyond Earth. The detection of Dyson spheres would be a significant discovery, and would provide evidence of the existence of advanced civilizations in the universe. However, the search for Dyson spheres is a challenging task, and would require the development of new technologies and instruments.\n\nIn conclusion, the search for advanced alien civilizations is an exciting and ongoing effort, and the concept of Dyson spheres is a fascinating idea that has been proposed as a way to search for these civilizations. While the search for Dyson spheres is a challenging task, it has the potential to provide significant insights into the existence of advanced civilizations in the universe.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Despite his notoriety, Simpson has been a model prisoner, and his lawyers argue that he deserves parole due to his good behavior and the fact that he has served nearly a decade in prison.

The law, which was passed by the Jamaican parliament, allows for the possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana, and cultivation of five or fewer plants on any premises. The law also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe law is a significant victory for the Rastafarian community, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament. The law also paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.\n\nThe law does not mean that Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. National security minister Peter Bunting emphasized that the security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe law is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and several countries, including Uruguay and Argentina, have decriminalized or legalized marijuana.\n\nThe law has been welcomed by cannabis crusaders, who see it as a big step in the right direction. However, there is still much work to be done to refine the details of the law and establish a functioning medical marijuana industry.\n\nThe law has significant implications for Jamaica's economy, particularly in the areas of health tourism and the development of innovative pot-derived items. Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton has said that the cannabis industry holds great potential for Jamaica, which is labouring under its latest loan programme with the International Monetary Fund.\n\nOverall, the law is a significant step towards decriminalizing marijuana in Jamaica and paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It is a legal procedure that prevents the government from holding individuals indefinitely without showing cause. The Founders of the United States enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution, considering it a fundamental right that ensures the executive branch cannot hold people without cause. However, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, potentially allowing the government to detain individuals without legal recourse.\n\nThe MCA has eroded the foundation of the U.S. legal and constitutional framework, compromising the core legal value of habeas corpus. The government has little evidence against most Guantanamo detainees, with many being sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite legal victories affirming the detainees' right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts.\n\nIn a separate development, a New York judge has granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, potentially recognizing chimpanzees as legal persons. The ruling could force the university to release the primates and sway additional judges to do the same with other research animals.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a major victory and plans to use it to sway judges in other jurisdictions. The group aims to free chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals from captivity, arguing that they are autonomous beings with the right to bodily liberty. The ruling has sparked debate, with some experts cautioning against reading too much into the decision, while others see it as a significant step forward in recognizing animal rights. \n\nIn conclusion, the concept of habeas corpus remains a crucial aspect of Western law, ensuring that individuals are not held indefinitely without cause. However, the MCA has compromised this right, and the government's treatment of Guantanamo detainees raises concerns about the erosion of due process. The recent ruling on the chimpanzees' habeas corpus petition highlights the growing recognition of animal rights and the potential for future legal challenges to the treatment of research animals. \n\nWord Count:", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

{"pred": " \nScientists have made significant discoveries about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once a warm and wet world with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, lasted for millions of years and was a major factor in the planet's habitability. The discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and finding that it contains a high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, which is a result of the planet's water loss over time.\n\nAccording to NASA scientists, the ocean on Mars was formed when the planet's atmosphere was much thicker and the pressure was high enough to keep the water liquid. The ocean was likely formed in the northern hemisphere, which has a lower altitude than the southern hemisphere. The scientists estimate that the ocean would have covered an area of about 20% of the planet's surface, which is equivalent to the Atlantic Ocean on Earth.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. The presence of liquid water on Mars in the past suggests that the planet may have been habitable for life, and the discovery of methane on Mars by NASA's Curiosity rover has sparked speculation that the gas may be coming from living organisms.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the presence of methane on Mars can also be explained by geological processes, and there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that the gas is coming from living organisms. Nevertheless, the discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars and the presence of methane on the planet suggest that the search for life on Mars is an exciting and promising area of research.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of the ancient ocean, scientists have also found that the planet's water loss over time has led to a significant increase in the concentration of deuterium in the Martian atmosphere. This has allowed scientists to estimate the amount of water that was lost over time, and they have found that the planet's water loss was equivalent to a global ocean that would have reached a depth of about 137 meters.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars and the planet's water loss over time have significant implications for our understanding of the planet's history and its potential for supporting life. The search for life on Mars is an ongoing area of research, and the discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars suggests that the planet may have been habitable for life in the past.\n\nOverall, the discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars is a significant finding that has shed new light on the planet's history and", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Turner, who was not willing to leave her student to die without trying to do something, contacted the university's security chief Per Gustafson, who arranged a rescue operation with a security company. Over a few days of intense activity, two Landcruisers carrying four heavily-armed mercenaries roared into the area where Jumaah was hiding and sped him away to Erbil Airport together with his wife and two small children.

This unique event was the first time a university had been involved in a rescue operation of this kind. \n\nThe rescue operation was a result of Turner's determination to help her student and his family, who were facing a life-and-death situation.

The ruling sends the case back to the EU's trademark office, which must review a 2012 decision to uphold Nestlé's trademark. The decision has implications for brands operating across the EU single market, where there are varying histories in national markets. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has also been featured in Britain's Brexit debate. Some supporters of cutting ties with the EU have suggested that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat. The ruling does not affect the brand name \"KitKat,\" only the shape of the bar. Nestlé has said that it believes the EU trademark office will side with the company and that the decision is not the end of the case. The company has spent over a decade fighting to trademark the shape of the KitKat bar, which has been a source of contention with rival Cadbury. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars. The ruling has implications for other chocolate companies, including Mondelez, which owns brands such as Cadbury and Toblerone. The company has won a trademark for the shape of Toblerone, but has lost a trademark for the shape of KitKat. The case has been ongoing for over a decade and has been the subject of numerous appeals and court rulings. The European Court of Justice's ruling is a significant development in the case and has implications for the future of the KitKat brand in the EU. \n\nThe case has also highlighted the complexities of trademark law in the EU, where companies must demonstrate that their brand is distinctive and recognizable across multiple countries. The ruling has been seen as a victory for Mondelez, which had argued that Nestlé's trademark was invalid. The case has also raised questions about the role of EU courts in protecting national brands and the implications of Brexit for trademark law in the UK. \n\nIn related news, the Norwegian chocolate bar Kvikk Lunsj, which has a similar shape to the KitKat bar, has been cleared to be sold in the EU without infringing on Nestlé's trademark. The bar has been made since 1937 and has a different flavor profile than the KitKat bar.

Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat. Even if that's the case, the European Union's highest court just ruled that the shape of the sweet treat isn't unique enough to merit trademark protection, meaning other confectioners can potentially produce KitKat knockoffs, the Guardian reports. Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": " \nThe roar of the T. rex has been a staple of popular culture for decades, but new research suggests that the mighty dinosaur may not have been as loud as we think. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T. rex and other dinosaurs may have made sounds more similar to birds, such as pigeons or ostriches, rather than the loud roars depicted in movies and TV shows. The study found that dinosaurs may have used a type of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization, which involves making sounds through the skin in the neck rather than through the mouth. This type of vocalization is common in birds, particularly in large species such as ostriches and emus.\n\nThe study's authors used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptiles, and found that it has evolved independently at least 16 times in different species. They also found that only large-bodied species, such as doves and ostriches, use closed-mouth vocalization, suggesting that it may have been an adaptation for attracting mates or defending territory.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. While we can't know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, the study suggests that they may have made sounds that were more similar to birds than we previously thought. This challenges the popular image of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures, and instead suggests that they may have been more subtle and nuanced in their communication.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the discovery of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptiles may have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalization. By studying the anatomy and physiology of bird vocalization, scientists may be able to gain insights into the evolution of bird communication and behavior.\n\nIn related news, a sound designer for the movie Jurassic Park revealed that the iconic T. rex roar was created using a combination of animal sounds, including a baby elephant and a horse. The sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, used a variety of techniques to create the sound, including layering different sounds and using a technique called \"foley\" to create the sound of the T. rex's footsteps.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication is more complex and nuanced than we previously thought.

Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Recently, there have been discussions about using statistical tools, specifically Bayesian inference, to help locate the plane. Bayesian inference is a method of statistical analysis that uses probability to make predictions and decisions. It was used in the search for Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in 2009, and was successful in locating the plane.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, a team of statisticians from Metron Inc. used Bayesian inference to analyze the data and create a probability map of where the plane might be. The team, led by Colleen Keller, used historical data from previous crashes and the characteristics of the plane to create a model of the probability of the plane being in different locations. They also used the fact that planes tend to stay close to their last known location after a crash.\n\nThe team's initial analysis suggested that the plane was likely to be in a certain area of the ocean, but they were unable to find it. However, they were asked to re-analyze the data and adjust their model, and this time they were able to locate the plane. The plane was found in 2011, and the investigation revealed that the pilots had lost control of the plane due to a faulty speed indicator.\n\nThe use of Bayesian inference in the search for Air France Flight 447 was successful, and it has been suggested that it could be used in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. However, the search for Flight 370 is more complex and challenging than the search for Flight 447, and it is not clear whether Bayesian inference will be successful in this case.\n\nColleen Keller, the lead statistician on the Air France Flight 447 case, has expressed skepticism about the chances of finding Flight 370. She said that it is very likely that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and will never be found. She also noted that even if debris is found, it may not be enough to locate the bulk of the plane.\n\nThe use of Bayesian inference in the search for missing planes is a promising development, but it is not a guarantee of success. The method relies on the availability of data and the ability to create a accurate model of the probability of the plane being in different locations.

This event is special because it is the first total lunar eclipse of a blue moon in nearly 152 years. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America. The moon will take on a reddish hue during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere bending the light.\n\nThe event is also a supermoon, which is a full moon that appears when the moon is at its closest point to Earth.

The moon will appear its biggest and brightest during this time due to a \"moon illusion\" effect. If it is cloudy or too cold to go outside, there are options to view the event from the comfort of your own home.\n\nPhotographing the supermoon or the lunar eclipse can be done with a smartphone or a DSLR camera. To take a good picture, it is recommended to use the right exposure and shutter speed, and to put the moon in context of a local landmark.\n\nThe event is safe to view with the naked eye, and no special glasses are needed.

A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far.

His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
