{"pred": " \nThe Occupy Wall Street movement continues to spread across the United States, with protests and demonstrations taking place in various cities. In Philadelphia, about 100 Occupy Philly protesters remained on site at City Hall into the evening of Nov. 28, despite a deadline set by Mayor Michael Nutter for them to leave. The protesters, who were serving a permit, were allowed to stay, and police continued to monitor the situation. In Los Angeles, police in riot gear closed in on the Occupy LA encampment at City Hall before dawn on Monday, but stopped short of clearing the area. The protesters, who had defied a midnight deadline to leave, were allowed to stay, and four were arrested during a tense standoff. In New York City, the NYPD declared an unlawful assembly on the streets surrounding City Hall, but did not make any arrests. The Occupy Wall Street movement, which began two months ago, has spread to over 100 cities across the United States, with protesters demanding economic reform and an end to corporate greed. The movement has been met with varying degrees of resistance from local authorities, with some cities tolerating the protests and others cracking down on them. The movement's message of economic justice and equality has resonated with many Americans, who are frustrated with the current state of the economy and the influence of corporate power. As the movement continues to grow and spread, it remains to be seen how local authorities will respond to the protests and whether the movement will be able to achieve its goals. \n\nKey points:\n\n* Occupy Philly protesters remain on site at City Hall despite deadline\n* Occupy LA protesters defy deadline, but police stop short of clearing area\n* NYPD declares unlawful assembly, but makes no arrests\n* Four Occupy LA protesters arrested during tense standoff\n* Occupy Wall Street movement spreads to over 100 cities across US\n* Protesters demand economic reform and an end to corporate greed\n* Local authorities respond with varying degrees of resistance\n* Movement's message of economic justice and equality resonates with many Americans. \n\nNote: The summary is a general overview of the news, and is not a detailed analysis of each event.

{"pred": " \n\nMikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47 assault rifle, expressed his fears of being morally responsible for the people killed by his invention in a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, before his death. The letter, written in May 2012, was published by Izvestia, a Russian newspaper, and revealed Kalashnikov's spiritual pain and guilt over the use of his rifle in conflicts around the world. Kalashnikov, who died in December 2013 at the age of 94, designed the AK-47 after experiencing the dire lack of weapons during World War II. He had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. However, in his letter, he questioned whether he was to blame for the deaths, saying \"if my rifle claimed people's lives, then can it be that I... a Christian and an Orthodox believer, was to blame for their deaths?\" Kalashnikov's letter was typed on his personal writing paper and signed with a wavering hand, suggesting that he may have had help from a priest in composing it. The Russian Orthodox Church has a position that when weapons are used to defend the country, they are not to be blamed, and Patriarch Kirill wrote a reply to Kalashnikov's letter, stating that the Church supports the creators of weapons that serve to protect the country. Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, and he was buried with full military honors.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

Ashton's comments about the meeting are the first news of Morsi's condition from a source outside of the military in nearly a month. Ashton's meeting with Morsi was seen as a significant development in Egypt's ongoing political crisis, which has left at least 80 people dead in recent clashes between security forces and Morsi supporters. The meeting was also seen as a sign that Egypt's military may be willing to work towards a political solution to the crisis. Ashton met with a wide range of Egyptian political figures during her two-day visit, including General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, the commander of the armed forces, and Mohamed ElBaradei, the interim vice president. Ashton emphasized that the people of Egypt must take the lead in finding a solution to the crisis, and that the international community is there to support them.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has revealed another alarming consequence: it fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA bacteria exposed to cigarette smoke become more resistant to killing and more aggressive, making them a more formidable foe for the human immune system.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine conducted the study, which found that cigarette smoke alters the structure of MRSA, making it more resistant to common antibiotics. The study also discovered that the increased resistance to antibiotics is not limited to MRSA, as e-cigarette vapor has also been found to have a similar effect on the bacteria.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, a pulmonologist at UC San Diego and the Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, stated that cigarette smoke \"stresses\" the MRSA bacteria, making them more aggressive and resistant to killing.

This has significant implications for public health, as it highlights the need for individuals to avoid smoking and e-cigarette use to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nIn addition to the study's findings, researchers have also discovered that cigarette smoke can alter the structure of MRSA, making it more resistant to common antibiotics.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The study used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze the links between Wikipedia pages. The initial results showed that Carl Linnaeus, an 18th-century Swedish naturalist, was the most important person in the world. However, this result was skewed by the fact that Linnaeus is the originator of the scientific system of naming, and many Wikipedia pages referencing scientific names lead back to him.\n\nTo get a more accurate result, the researchers applied a second method, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from a page. They then combined the two methods to get a final measure, 2DRank. Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII.\n\nHowever, a subsequent study by the same researcher, Young-Ho Eom, found that Carl Linnaeus was again the most influential thinker in the world, according to Wikipedia links. This result was attributed to the fact that Linnaeus is the originator of the scientific system of naming, and many Wikipedia pages referencing scientific names lead back to him.\n\nThe study also found that the most influential thinkers in the world are often those who have made significant contributions to their field, such as Linnaeus in taxonomy and Newton in physics. The study suggests that intellectual success depends on what came before, as Newton famously said, \"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of Wikipedia as a source of information and the need to preserve links to archived pages to prevent broken links on the web.

According to Lumos, there are 8 million children worldwide who are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in inhumane conditions. The charity has been working to shed light on the lives of these children and to advocate for their rights.\n\nRowling recounts how she was inspired to start Lumos after seeing a photograph of a child locked in a cage in a newspaper. The image shocked her and she felt compelled to take action. She began writing letters to influential people and eventually established Lumos, which is named after the spell she created in the Harry Potter series to bring light to dark places.\n\nLumos has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, where the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since 2007. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 50% since Lumos began working there. The charity estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050.\n\nRowling emphasizes that the solution to this problem is not just about providing better conditions in institutions, but about ending the practice of institutionalization altogether. She argues that it is more cost-effective to support families and provide inclusive education and healthcare, rather than building and maintaining institutions.\n\nLumos is calling on international donors to support their efforts to end institutionalization. The charity believes that this is not only a moral imperative, but also an excellent investment opportunity, as it can lead to significant economic benefits.\n\nRowling has committed to becoming the president of Lumos for life and is determined to see an end to the practice of institutionalization in her lifetime.

Kim Jong-nam was poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent called VX at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on February 13. Malaysian police have confirmed that the substance used to kill Kim Jong-nam was VX, a banned chemical weapon. The two women accused of carrying out the attack, Doan Thi Huong from Vietnam and Siti Aisyah from Indonesia, are being held in custody. \n\nNorth Korea has denied any involvement in the assassination, but many experts believe that the attack was orchestrated by the North Korean government. The use of VX, a highly toxic and banned chemical weapon, suggests a high level of sophistication and resources, which is consistent with the capabilities of the North Korean government. \n\nThe case has raised concerns about public safety in Malaysia, as the airport was not decontaminated after the attack, and the VX nerve agent could have been spread to other people. The Malaysian government has come under criticism for its handling of the case, with many questioning why it took 11 days to confirm the use of VX. \n\nThe diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea has escalated, with North Korea expelling the Malaysian ambassador and recalling its own ambassador from Malaysia. The Malaysian government has also expelled the North Korean ambassador and suspended diplomatic relations with North Korea. \n\nThe use of VX in the assassination has also raised concerns about the capabilities of North Korea's chemical weapons program. North Korea is believed to have a large stockpile of chemical weapons, including VX, and has been accused of using them in the past. The use of VX in the assassination suggests that North Korea may be willing to use its chemical weapons in the future. \n\nThe case has also raised questions about the role of the two women accused of carrying out the attack. While they have been accused of being involved in the assassination, many experts believe that they may have been unwitting pawns in a larger game.

He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated. North Korea—which is widely suspected to have been behind the killing of leader Kim Jong Un's half brother—never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention that banned VX, the AP notes.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle.

The app, developed by Xora, allowed Intermex to monitor the location of its employees 24/7, which Arias claims was an invasion of her privacy. According to the lawsuit, Arias was one of the first employees to be asked to install the app, and she was told that it was necessary for her to meet her sales targets. However, Arias researched the app and discovered that it was not only tracking her location but also her speed and other personal data. She objected to the app, likening it to a \"prisoner's ankle bracelet,\" and was subsequently fired by her boss, John Stubbs. Arias claims that she was a high-performing employee who earned $7,500 per month, but was let go after she refused to install the app. The lawsuit alleges that Intermex's actions were a violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy and retaliation. Arias is seeking damages in excess of $500,000 and an injunction to prevent Intermex from using the app to track its employees. The case has sparked concerns about the use of location-tracking technology in the workplace and the potential for employers to abuse their power. Intermex has not responded to the lawsuit, but the company's president, Robert Lisy, has been accused of making a phone call to Arias' previous employer, NetSpend, to inform them that she was no longer employed by Intermex, which led to her being fired from her previous job.

Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

Merritt was arrested on September 18, 2015, and was being held in jail on a $1 million bond. However, a judge recently reduced the bond to zero, allowing Merritt to be released from jail under electronic monitoring. Merritt's defense lawyers argued that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind the shootings. The judge overseeing the case, Warren Granville, imposed a gag order on lawyers in the case, preventing them from discussing the evidence. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is scheduled to appear in court on May 18.\n\nIn the second incident, a driver suspected of firing a gun at motorists on an Alabama highway was killed in a shootout with police. The incident occurred on Tuesday morning in Blount County, Alabama, where the driver was involved in a pursuit with state troopers. The driver crashed his vehicle and exchanged gunfire with officers before being pronounced dead. The suspect's name was not released, and no other details were available.\n\nBoth incidents highlight the need for increased vigilance and cooperation between law enforcement agencies to prevent and investigate such crimes.

The movie, directed by Peter Jackson, tells the story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is murdered in 1973. The story is narrated by Susie from heaven, where she watches over her family and killer. The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Susie, Stanley Tucci as her father, and Mark Wahlberg as her killer.\n\nThe movie has received mixed reviews from critics. Some have praised the film's visuals and performances, particularly Ronan's portrayal of Susie. However, others have criticized the film's tone, which they feel is inconsistent and overly sentimental. The film's depiction of heaven has also been criticized as being too cheesy and artificial.\n\nThe novel, on which the film is based, is a more complex and nuanced exploration of grief, trauma, and the afterlife. The book's narrative is non-linear and multi-layered, and it explores themes of guilt, shame, and redemption. The film, on the other hand, is more straightforward and simplistic, and it focuses on the surface-level emotions of the characters.\n\nDespite its flaws, the film has its moments of beauty and power. The cinematography is stunning, and the performances are generally strong. The film's climax, which depicts Susie's killer being brought to justice, is particularly effective.\n\nOverall, The Lovely Bones is a film that is both captivating and frustrating.

The shutdown, which could occur as early as Monday night, would affect hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors, causing widespread economic disruption in the Washington region. \n\nAccording to local economist Stephen Fuller, the shutdown could cost the region an estimated $200 million a day, with the national impact estimated to be around $1 billion a day. The shutdown would also affect the processing of new applications for federal benefits, including Social Security and Medicare, and would cause delays in the processing of tax refunds. \n\nThe shutdown would also have a significant impact on the tourism industry, with many national parks and monuments closed.

Many workers would be furloughed, with some facing up to 30 days without pay. The shutdown would also affect the processing of veterans' benefits and would cause delays in the processing of passport applications. \n\nThe shutdown is the result of a standoff between Congress and the White House over the budget and the Affordable Care Act.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business.

The mission is named after Eugene Parker, a renowned astrophysicist who predicted the existence of the solar wind. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to touch the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun. The spacecraft will be equipped with a heat shield to protect it from the intense heat of the sun. The mission aims to study the sun's corona and the solar wind, which is a stream of charged particles that flows away from the sun. The spacecraft will also study the sun's magnetic field and the solar wind's interaction with the Earth's magnetic field. The mission will provide valuable insights into the sun's behavior and its impact on the Earth's climate and space weather. The Parker Solar Probe is scheduled to launch in the summer of 2018 and will take about 7 years to complete its mission. The spacecraft will fly within 4 million miles of the sun's surface, which is closer than any other spacecraft has ever been. The mission will also carry a chip with the name of Eugene Parker, who will be the first person to have a spacecraft named after him while he is still alive. The Parker Solar Probe is a historic mission that will revolutionize our understanding of the sun and its impact on the Earth. The mission will also help scientists to better understand the solar wind and its effects on the Earth's magnetic field and climate.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

The companies, including Acxiom, Experian, and Equifax, have refused to explain how they collect their data and who they sell it to, citing confidentiality clauses. The report also revealed that some data brokers sell lists of consumers suffering from conditions like cancer, depression, and addiction, as well as lists of police officers' home addresses.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit organization, has also uncovered these lists and is calling for tighter government regulations to protect individual privacy. The group's executive director, Pam Dixon, testified before Congress that the mere existence of these lists highlights the need for increased oversight. Dixon noted that data brokers are required to maintain the privacy of consumer data only if it is used for credit, employment, or housing purposes, but not for other purposes.\n\nThe data industry has grown exponentially, with no relevant consumer protection laws in place to protect individual privacy. Consumers have no right to find out what information is being collected about them or who is buying it. The industry's lack of transparency has led to the sale of sensitive information, which can put people in harm's way.

The new planet, called Planet 9, is a gas giant that is thought to be about 10 times the size of Earth and is located in the outer reaches of the solar system. The discovery was made by a team of researchers led by Dr. Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet to a dwarf planet.\n\nDr. Brown and his team used a combination of observations and computer simulations to identify the new planet, which is thought to be a gas giant with a highly eccentric orbit. The planet is believed to be about 200 astronomical units (AU) from the sun, which is much farther away than Pluto.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 has sparked a lot of excitement in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. However, not everyone is convinced that the new planet is a true planet. Some scientists argue that it is too small and too distant to be considered a planet, and that it should be classified as a dwarf planet like Pluto.\n\nDespite the controversy, Dr. Brown is confident that Planet 9 is a real planet and that it will be officially recognized as such by the scientific community. He believes that the discovery of the new planet will help to shed light on the formation and evolution of our solar system, and that it will provide new insights into the nature of the universe.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 has also sparked renewed interest in Pluto, which was demoted from its status as a planet in 2006. Some scientists are calling for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet, but Dr. Brown is opposed to this idea. He believes that Pluto is a unique and fascinating object that deserves to be studied and appreciated in its own right, but that it is not a planet.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet 9 is a major breakthrough that has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system.

At least one half of well-constructed homes will have roof and wall failure.\" Ricks' document also warned of \"water shortages that will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" The forecast was a turning point in the National Weather Service's approach to weather emergencies, as it marked a shift towards using more direct and urgent language to convey the severity of the situation. Ricks' forecast was a personal plea to the public to take the storm seriously and evacuate, and it was a crucial factor in saving lives. However, the response to the storm was still inadequate, and Ricks was heartbroken by the devastation that occurred. He had grown up in the Lower Ninth Ward, which was one of the hardest-hit areas, and he had experienced the impact of previous storms, including Hurricane Betsy and Camille. Ricks' forecast was a testament to the importance of accurate and timely weather forecasting, and it served as a reminder of the need for effective communication during natural disasters. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it may not fit in a single box due to the formatting requirements. \n\nAlso, I would like to point out that the two passages are quite similar, and it would be better to have more diverse sources to provide a more comprehensive summary. \n\nHere is a possible way to expand the summary:\n\n* Add more information about the impact of Hurricane Katrina, such as the number of people affected, the economic damage, and the long-term effects on the city.\n* Include more quotes from Robert Ricks and other experts to provide a more nuanced understanding of the storm and its aftermath.\n* Discuss the changes that have been made to the National Weather Service's approach to weather emergencies since Hurricane Katrina, and how they have improved the effectiveness of weather forecasting.\n* Provide more context about the storm's history, including its formation, track, and intensity.\n* Include more information about the response to the storm, including the evacuation efforts, the role of emergency responders, and the challenges faced by the city and its residents.\n\nI hope this helps!

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf.

Recently, Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, was bullied off of Twitter and Instagram after her father's death. The abuse she faced included messages blaming her for her father's suicide and pictures of her father altered to show bruises around his neck. Twitter has since suspended several accounts related to the incident and promised to update its policies to better handle tragic situations like this one.\n\nHowever, this incident is just one example of the types of abuse many users face on Twitter. Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst, wrote about the constant abuse she faces on the service every day, including racist and sexist comments. She has been unable to stop the abuse despite blocking over a thousand accounts and reporting the abuse to Twitter.\n\nTwitter's tools for reporting abuse and harassment have been criticized for not being effective. The company's \"Report Abuse\" form has been used to report threats of rape and other forms of harassment, but Twitter has not taken action in many cases. The company's commitment to free expression may be clouding its judgment on this issue, with some critics arguing that it is prioritizing the rights of abusers over the safety of its users.\n\nIn response to the criticism, Twitter has promised to update its policies and improve its tools for handling harassment. The company has also been working with third-party software developers to create more robust protections for users. One such software, called \"Block Together,\" allows users to automatically block new accounts that send them direct messages.\n\nThe Internet Archive has been collecting data on the web since 1996, including Twitter's data.

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2012. The findings suggest that younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer at an advanced stage, and that they are more likely to experience recurrence and metastasis. The researchers also found that younger patients are more likely to be treated with aggressive therapies, which can have significant side effects. Despite these findings, the study's authors caution that the data does not necessarily support changing the current screening guidelines for colorectal cancer, which recommend starting screenings at age 50. However, they do suggest that doctors should be more vigilant in screening younger patients, particularly those with a family history of colorectal cancer. The study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, notes that the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients is a \"wake-up call\" for the medical community, and that doctors should be aware of the warning signs of the disease, including rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits. Dr. Hendren also emphasizes the importance of early detection and treatment, and suggests that doctors should consider screening younger patients who are at high risk for the disease. Overall, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting and treating colorectal cancer in younger patients. \n\nKey statistics:\n\n* One in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50\n* Younger patients are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease\n* Younger patients are more likely to experience recurrence and metastasis\n* Younger patients are more likely to be treated with aggressive therapies\n* The incidence of colorectal cancer in younger patients is increasing\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* Doctors should be more vigilant in screening younger patients, particularly those with a family history of colorectal cancer\n* Doctors should consider screening younger patients who are at high risk for the disease\n* Early detection and treatment are crucial in improving outcomes for younger patients with colorectal cancer\n* The medical community should be aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, including rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as the Warratyi rock-shelter, is located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide. The discovery pushes back the known timeline of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by at least 10,000 years.\n\nThe site contains a treasure trove of artifacts, including stone tools, ochre, and evidence of human interaction with megafauna, such as emus and giant marsupials. The tools, which include quartz and flint, are some of the oldest ever found in Australia, and suggest that early humans were able to adapt to the harsh conditions of the arid interior.\n\nThe discovery also challenges the long-held assumption that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as other cultures. The tools found at the site are sophisticated and demonstrate a high level of technological advancement, suggesting that early humans in Australia were able to develop complex technologies independently.\n\nThe site was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by Giles Hamm, who has been excavating the site for several years. Hamm and his team used a combination of radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to date the artifacts, which were found to be between 49,000 and 44,000 years old.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human migration and settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to move quickly and easily across the continent, and that the arid interior was not as inhospitable as previously thought.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature and has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological discoveries in recent years. The discovery is also significant for the Indigenous Australian community, who have long argued that their ancestors were capable of complex technological and cultural achievements.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists, with some arguing that the dating of the artifacts is not as secure as claimed. However, the majority of the scientific community has welcomed the discovery and its implications for our understanding of human history in Australia.\n\nIn related news, a recent study published in the journal Nature has found that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed a three-stage model of galactic expansion, where a civilization would first harness all the resources of its planet (Level I), then its star (Level II), and finally its galaxy (Level III). Recently, a paper by Dan Hooper revived Kardashev's model and added a new twist, suggesting that advanced civilizations would need to harvest energy from distant stars to prevent the universe from leaving them behind. This would involve creating a massive network of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture the energy of stars.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and has since been explored in science fiction. In reality, scientists believe that advanced civilizations could use Dyson spheres to harness the energy of stars, and that this could be a way to detect the presence of extraterrestrial life. However, the technology to create such structures is still far beyond our current capabilities.\n\nHooper's paper suggests that advanced civilizations could be using Dyson spheres to harvest energy from distant stars, and that this could be detectable by astronomers. He proposes that we could look for signs of these structures by searching for unusual patterns of starlight, or by looking for the heat signatures of massive satellites. However, the technology to detect such structures is still in its infancy, and it may be many years before we are able to confirm the presence of extraterrestrial life.\n\nIn addition to the search for extraterrestrial life, the concept of Dyson spheres has also been explored in science fiction. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described spherical energy-trapping structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\", and physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in his 1960 paper. The idea of Dyson spheres has since been explored in numerous science fiction stories, including the TV show \"Star Trek\".\n\nOverall, the concept of Dyson spheres represents a fascinating intersection of science and science fiction, and highlights the possibilities and challenges of searching for extraterrestrial life. While the technology to create such structures is still far beyond our current capabilities, the idea of Dyson spheres continues to inspire scientists and science fiction writers alike. \n\nNote: The summary is a one-page summary of all the news, and it is written in a neutral tone.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago.

An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

The young actress, now 26, has chosen to remain anonymous, and her parents did not press charges at the time. Sizemore's agent, Stephen Rice, has declined to comment on the allegations. The film's producers, Jai Stefan, Michael Mansfield, and Gus Spolansky, have also spoken out about the incident, stating that they took Sizemore's alleged behavior seriously and removed him from the set. However, they also acknowledged that they did not press charges and allowed Sizemore to return to the set for reshoots. Sizemore has a long history of controversy, including a 2003 conviction for battery against women and a 2017 arrest for domestic violence. He has also struggled with addiction and has been to rehab multiple times. Despite his troubled past, Sizemore has continued to work in the entertainment industry, appearing in films and TV shows such as \"Saving Private Ryan,\" \"Black Hawk Down,\" and \"Twin Peaks.\" The allegations against Sizemore come at a time when the entertainment industry is facing increased scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse of power. The incident has sparked a renewed conversation about the need for greater accountability and transparency in the industry. Sizemore's representatives have not commented on the allegations, and it is unclear what actions will be taken against him. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of creating a safe and respectful work environment for all individuals in the entertainment industry. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it may not fit in a standard 8.5 x 11 inch page due to the formatting. \n\nAlso, I have removed some of the details from the original passages to make the summary more concise and easier to read.

He graduated from high school and went on to attend Texas Tech University.\n\nIn 1998, Cruz asked Hooper and her husband to officially adopt him.

He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated.

The legislation also paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp.\n\nThe new law is a significant victory for the Rastafarian community, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament. It also marks a shift in the island's approach to marijuana, which has been culturally entrenched but illegal for decades. The law is expected to have a positive impact on the island's economy, with the potential for a new industry to emerge.\n\nThe legislation was passed after several hours of debate in the Jamaican parliament, with lawmakers voting in favor of the bill.

Uruguay was the first country to legalize marijuana in 2013, and Argentina has also decriminalized possession of small quantities.\n\nThe Jamaican government has stated that the law does not intend to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking, and that the security forces will continue to enforce international laws.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, a legal procedure that allows individuals to challenge their detention, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. The Founding Fathers of the United States enshrined it in the Constitution, recognizing its importance in protecting individual liberties. However, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act revoked the right to habeas corpus for non-citizens, including those detained at Guantanamo Bay. This move has been widely criticized as a threat to the rule of law and the principles of democracy.\n\nIn a related development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, held at Stony Brook University. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted a writ of habeas corpus, which typically allows human prisoners to challenge their detention. The ruling could have significant implications for the treatment of animals in research and could potentially lead to the release of the chimpanzees.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the chimpanzees, sees this as a major victory and a step towards recognizing the rights of animals. The group's executive director, Natalie Prosin, stated that the ruling \"got us a foot in the door\" and that it could sway judges in other jurisdictions to recognize the rights of animals.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced that the ruling is a significant breakthrough. Richard Cupp, a law professor, cautioned that the judge's decision may not necessarily imply that chimpanzees are considered legal persons. Instead, it may be a procedural decision that allows the case to proceed.\n\nThe implications of this ruling are far-reaching and could have significant consequences for the treatment of animals in research and beyond. If the Nonhuman Rights Project is successful in its efforts to recognize the rights of animals, it could lead to a fundamental shift in the way we think about the relationship between humans and animals.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of habeas corpus has been a cornerstone of Western law for centuries, but its application to animals is a relatively new development. The ruling in the case of Hercules and Leo is a significant step forward, but its implications are still unclear. As the debate over animal rights continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how this ruling plays out in the courts and in society at large. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not take a stance on the issue of animal", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

The discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and finding evidence of water vapor and methane, which are signs of a liquid water ocean.\n\nThe scientists used powerful telescopes and infra-red maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's water loss was much greater than previously thought.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": " \nThe roar of the T-Rex has been a staple of dinosaur movies for decades, but new research suggests that the mighty predator may not have made the sound we think it did. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, dinosaurs may have made low-frequency sounds, similar to those made by birds, rather than the loud roars depicted in popular culture. The study, which analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species, found that many birds use a specialized form of vocalization called closed-mouth vocalization, where they make sounds with their beaks closed. This type of vocalization is thought to be an adaptation for making low-frequency sounds, which are better suited for long-distance communication.\n\nThe researchers behind the study suggest that dinosaurs may have used a similar form of vocalization, and that some may have even made closed-mouth sounds during mating displays. This idea is supported by the fact that many dinosaurs had large body sizes, which would have allowed them to produce low-frequency sounds. The study also found that closed-mouth vocalization has evolved independently in at least 16 different bird lineages, suggesting that it may have been a common trait in ancient birds.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. It suggests that dinosaurs may have been more subtle and nuanced in their vocalizations than previously thought, and that they may have used a range of different sounds to communicate with each other. This idea is supported by the fact that many modern birds use a range of different vocalizations to communicate, including low-frequency sounds, high-pitched chirps, and even mimicry of other sounds.\n\nThe study's lead author, Chad Eliason, said that the discovery was a \"game-changer\" for our understanding of dinosaur behavior. \"It's a completely new way of thinking about how dinosaurs communicated,\" he said. \"We've always thought of them as loud, roaring creatures, but it's possible that they were actually making much more subtle sounds.\"\n\nThe study's findings have also sparked interest in the sound design of dinosaur movies and documentaries. Gary Rydstrom, a sound designer who worked on the Jurassic Park franchise, said that the discovery was \"mind-blowing\" and that it would change the way he approaches sound design for dinosaur movies. \"It's a whole new world of possibilities,\" he said.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that dinosaurs may have been more complex and nuanced in their behavior and communication than previously thought, and that they may have used a range of different sounds to communicate with each other.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The Iranian judiciary claims that Shourd's absence is the reason for the delay, but her lawyer disputes this, saying that he was not informed of the postponement.

This achievement is a major leap towards understanding how the brain processes visual information and could potentially lead to the ability to see what's going on in someone's mind without visual stimulation.\n\nThe study, led by Shinji Nishimoto, used a computer model to match brain activity with features of the videos, allowing them to reconstruct the videos in a blurry, dream-like format.

The map was based on historical data and theories about the crash, and it helped to narrow down the search area.\n\nHowever, the search for Air France Flight 447 was ultimately unsuccessful, and the plane was not found until several months later. Keller and her team were able to adapt their model and make adjustments to their probability map, which ultimately led to the discovery of the plane's wreckage.\n\nThe same approach is being considered for the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. However, the search area is much larger, and the probability of finding the plane is much lower. Keller has expressed doubts about the likelihood of finding the plane, saying that it is \"very likely\" that the plane is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean and will never be found.\n\nDespite the challenges, the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is being considered. The method has been successful in the past, and it may be able to provide valuable insights into the location of the plane. However, the search is a complex and difficult one, and it is unclear whether Bayesian statistics will be able to provide the answers that investigators are looking for.\n\nIn related news, the use of Bayesian statistics has been successful in other searches, such as the search for the wreckage of the USS Indianapolis, which was sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1945. The use of Bayesian statistics has also been used in the search for missing persons, such as the search for the remains of a missing hiker in the mountains.\n\nOverall, the use of Bayesian statistics in the search for missing objects and persons is a promising approach that has been successful in the past.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

{"pred": " \n\nEgypt is in the midst of a significant transition period. The country is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of former President Hosni Mubarak in February 2011. The elections are being seen as a crucial step towards establishing a new government and paving the way for a democratic Egypt. \n\nThe final round of voting took place on Tuesday, with millions of Egyptians casting their ballots to elect their representatives to the People's Assembly. The Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, is expected to make significant gains in the elections, with many analysts predicting that they will emerge as the largest party in the assembly. \n\nThe Brotherhood's success in the elections is seen as a major shift in the country's politics, with many Egyptians embracing the group's conservative values and social policies. However, the group's rise to power has also raised concerns among secularists and liberals, who fear that the Brotherhood's Islamist agenda may undermine the country's secular traditions and human rights record. \n\nMeanwhile, the trial of former President Hosni Mubarak resumed on Tuesday, with the chief prosecutor accusing the ousted leader of imposing a \"tyrannical rule\" on Egypt. Mubarak is facing charges of complicity in the killing of hundreds of protesters during the uprising that led to his ousting. His two sons, Alaa and Gamal, are also on trial, facing corruption charges. \n\nThe trial has been bogged down in procedural matters, with lawyers representing the victims demanding that the presiding judge be removed. However, the prosecution has finally begun to present its case against Mubarak and his co-defendants, with the chief prosecutor delivering a scathing critique of the former leader's rule. \n\nMubarak's trial is seen as a crucial test of Egypt's commitment to accountability and justice, with many Egyptians demanding that the former leader be held accountable for his actions during the uprising. The trial is also seen as a major milestone in the country's transition to democracy, with many Egyptians hoping that it will pave the way for a new era of transparency and accountability in Egyptian politics. \n\nIn related news, the country's economic growth has slowed down significantly, with the government struggling to address the country's economic challenges. The country's foreign reserves have dwindled, and the government has been forced to impose austerity measures to address the economic crisis. \n\nOverall, Egypt is at a critical juncture in its history, with the country's future hanging in the balance. The outcome of the parliamentary elections and the trial of former President Mubarak", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
