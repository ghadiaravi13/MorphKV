{"pred": " Kirsty Williams stated that there was a trend of teacher recruiting, with only 65% of priority places filled in Welsh training centers, and that this was a problem that was not unique to Wales, but a global issue. She attributed the reasons for this trend to a lack of financial incentives, despite offering £20,000 to graduates, and that the issue was not just about ITE (Initial Teacher Education) but also about employment-based routes into teaching.

She also mentioned that they were looking at the issue of teacher diversity, and that they were working to increase the number of teachers from diverse backgrounds.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise.

The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to look into the cost difference between using an LCD display and not using one, and the Industrial Designer mentioned that the push-button requires a simple chip, the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and the LCD display requires an advanced chip, which is more expensive.
