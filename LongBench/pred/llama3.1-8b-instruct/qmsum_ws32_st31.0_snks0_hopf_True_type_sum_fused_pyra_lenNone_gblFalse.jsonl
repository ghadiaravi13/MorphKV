{"pred": " The meeting was a kick-off meeting for a project to design a new television remote control. The Project Manager presented the project's goals, including selling 50 million units at a profit of 50 million Euros, and introduced the team members, including the Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer, and Marketing representative. The team discussed the design of the remote control, including its shape, size, and functionality, and brainstormed ideas for its design. They also discussed the materials to be used, including plastic, and the technical aspects of the remote control, such as infrared transmission. The team decided to use a universal design that would be compatible with different television brands and models. The meeting ended with a discussion of the next steps and the tasks to be completed before the next meeting. The team members were assigned specific tasks, including researching the market and competitors, designing the remote control's user interface, and creating a prototype.

She also mentioned that the issue of teacher recruitment was not unique to Wales, but a global problem, and that they were working to understand the reasons behind it, including the decline in the number of students taking A-levels in subjects such as maths and physics. She also mentioned that they were looking at alternative routes into teaching, such as employment-based routes, and that they were working to increase the diversity of the teaching workforce. Additionally, she mentioned that they were taking steps to support students who had been through the Welsh education system and had developed their Welsh language skills, and that they were working to increase the number of teachers who could teach through the medium of Welsh. She also mentioned that they were looking at the issue of teacher retention, and that they were working to understand the reasons behind it, including the impact of workload and stress on teachers. She also mentioned that they were taking steps to support teachers, including providing additional funding and resources, and that they were working to improve the working conditions of teachers. Overall, Kirsty Williams emphasized that the issue of teacher recruitment and retention was complex and multifaceted, and that they were taking a comprehensive approach to address it.

{"pred": " The team discussed the use of advanced chips and LCD display in the remote control, with the Industrial Designer mentioning that it would increase the costs significantly, and the Marketing representative suggesting that it might be worth it if it would make the product more appealing to younger people. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to look into the cost difference between using an advanced chip with an LCD display versus a regular chip without an LCD display. The Industrial Designer noted that the push-button requires a simple chip, the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and the LCD display requires an advanced chip, with the advanced chip being the most expensive option. The team decided to create two concepts, one with an LCD display and one without, to compare the costs and usability. The Industrial Designer was tasked with looking into the cost of the joystick option, which was suggested as a possible alternative to the scroll wheel. The team agreed to have the Industrial Designer come up with a detailed design for the remote control, including the components and user interface, for the next meeting. The Project Manager emphasized the importance of keeping the costs in mind when making design decisions. The team also discussed the use of a kinetic battery, which was deemed too expensive, and decided to use a normal battery instead. The Industrial Designer was asked to come up with a design that would be easy to use and appealing to the target market, while also keeping the costs in mind. The team agreed to have a detailed design ready for the next meeting, with a focus on the components, user interface, and costs.
