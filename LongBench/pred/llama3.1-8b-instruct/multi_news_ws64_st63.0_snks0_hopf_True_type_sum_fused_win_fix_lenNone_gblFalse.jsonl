{"pred": " \nThe Occupy movement, a national protest against economic inequality and corporate greed, has been ongoing for two months. In Philadelphia, about 100 protesters remained on site at City Hall into the evening of Nov. 28, despite a deadline set by Mayor Nutter for them to leave. Police had no plans to evict anyone, and the protesters were allowed to stay, but they were warned that they would be prevented from setting up another camp elsewhere in the city without a permit. The city has said it needs to erect fencing this week for work at Dilworth Plaza, including renovation of the SEPTA tunnels and the addition of grass, a cafe, stage, and winter ice rink.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police in riot gear closed in on anti-Wall Street activists in Los Angeles who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment. Four demonstrators were arrested during a brief confrontation, accused of being present at an unlawful assembly. Later, attorneys for Occupy LA asked a federal judge for an injunction barring police from evicting the camp, arguing that Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and police chief Charlie Beck had violated their civil rights by ordering it dismantled. The Los Angeles encampment, which officials had tolerated for weeks, is among the largest on the West Coast aligned with the national Occupy Wall Street movement.\n\nIn other cities, the Occupy movement has faced similar challenges. In Oakland, police used force against Occupy protesters, leading to sporadic violence. In Philadelphia, the city has been relatively accommodating to its Occupy group, with Mayor Nutter providing ponchos to campers when it rained. However, after the collapse of negotiations aimed at persuading protesters to relocate voluntarily, the mayor said the encampment would have to go.\n\nThe Occupy movement has been marked by peaceful protests and demonstrations, with many protesters using social media to organize and communicate. The movement has also been supported by organized labor, clergy, and civil rights groups. Despite the challenges faced by the movement, many protesters remain committed to their cause and are determined to continue their fight for economic justice and restoration of balance to American society. \n\nKey points:\n\n* Occupy Philadelphia protesters remain on site at City Hall despite a deadline set by Mayor Nutter\n* Police in Los Angeles closed in on anti-Wall Street activists who defied a midnight deadline to vacate a camp outside City Hall, but stopped short of clearing the encampment\n* Four demonstrators were arrested during a brief confrontation in Los Angeles\n* Att", "answers": ["The Occupy LA encampment got a stay of execution this morning—though a few arrests have been reported beyond the boundaries of City Hall Park.

At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse.

In the letter, Kalashnikov asked if he was guilty for the deaths of people killed by his rifle, even if they were enemies. He also expressed his regret over the use of his rifle by criminals and child soldiers.\n\nKalashnikov's letter was a departure from his previous stance, where he refused to accept responsibility for the people killed by his rifle, blaming the policies of other countries that acquired it. The letter was typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and signed with a wavering hand by the man who described himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\"\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church responded to Kalashnikov's letter, with Patriarch Kirill's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, stating that the Church supports the creators and soldiers who use weapons to protect the Fatherland. Volkov also noted that Kalashnikov designed the rifle to defend his country, not to be used by terrorists.\n\nKalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, and he was remembered as a man who designed the rifle to defend his country, not to be used by terrorists.

During this time, paramedics waited 150 yards away because police had not declared the terminal safe to enter. It was not until 9:58 a.m. that airport police put Hernandez in a wheelchair and ran him to an ambulance. Hernandez was pronounced dead at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, despite efforts by doctors to revive him.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the coordination between police and fire officials, with some officials suggesting that a lack of coordination may have prevented speedy treatment for Hernandez and other victims. The Los Angeles Police Department, Los Angeles Fire Department, and Los Angeles Airport Police have declined to comment on the investigation until extensive reports are finished.\n\nThe incident has also highlighted the need for police and firefighters to receive first aid and CPR training.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has also revealed that it can fuel the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the immune system, making it harder to kill. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander of the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the study found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.\n\nThe study also found that the increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited. MRSA divides about every 30 minutes under ideal conditions, which means a single MRSA cell could generate nearly 17 million descendents in 12 hours. When put into mice, the smoke-exposed MRSA showed a significant difference in mortality compared to MRSA that had not been smoke exposed.\n\nFurthermore, the study found that cigarette smoke exposure stresses MRSA, causing it to alter its cell walls to repel toxic substances. This enhances survival against reactive oxygen species, which macrophages generate to kill pathogens. The study also found that the smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures.\n\nThe study suggests that cigarette smoke not only harms smokers but also assists pathogens, making them more resistant to the immune system. This is a concerning finding, as MRSA is a type of bacteria that causes life-threatening infections to the skin, bloodstream, or a surgical site, and sometimes causes pneumonia.\n\nIt is worth noting that a previous study conducted by the same researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also makes MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. The study suggests that cigarette smoke is a significant contributor to the increased resistance of MRSA, and that individuals should refrain from smoking to reduce the risk of MRSA infections.\n\nIn conclusion, the study highlights the dangers of cigarette smoke and its impact on the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections. The findings of this study have significant implications for public health, and emphasize the importance of quitting smoking to reduce the risk of MRSA infections. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote:", "answers": ["Superbugs such as MRSA are already bad enough.

It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous.

The illness affects the nervous system, specifically the spinal cord, and can cause symptoms such as limb weakness, facial drooping, and difficulty breathing. The exact cause of AFM is still unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses and adenoviruses.\n\nThe CDC has been tracking AFM since 2014, when 120 cases were reported in 34 states. The majority of cases occurred in children under the age of 10, with an average age of 7.6 years. Most patients reported a respiratory or febrile illness before developing neurologic symptoms, and many required hospitalization and ventilator support.\n\nDespite the increase in cases, there is still no specific treatment for AFM. The CDC recommends that parents and caregivers practice good hygiene, such as washing hands frequently and avoiding close contact with people who are sick. The CDC also advises that children should be up to date on all recommended vaccinations, including those for polio and other vaccine-preventable diseases.\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM, including the Roberts family, whose 3-year-old son Carter was diagnosed with the illness in July. Carter's mother, Robin, said that her son's symptoms developed rapidly, and he was left with significant weakness in his limbs. Despite the challenges, the family is hopeful that Carter will make a full recovery.\n\nThe CDC continues to investigate the cause of AFM and is working with partners nationally to track cases and identify risk factors.

The researchers, led by Matteo Borrini, a forensic scientist at Liverpool John Moores University, used real and synthetic blood samples to conduct seven different tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric.

The system allows users to play videogames and interact with the Xbox 360 console with gestures and spoken commands, without the need for a controller.

The system also allows users to train and play with a virtual tiger cub.\n\nMicrosoft also announced that Kinect will be available this fall, but pricing details were not revealed. The company will unveil more information about the system and its games at its Monday press conference.\n\nIn addition to the games, Microsoft also showed off dashboard apps that use motion controls to interact with Netflix, allowing users to scroll through photos, start live video chats with friends, and share photos.

According to Lumos, there are 8 million children worldwide who are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in atrocious conditions. The charity has been working to shed light on the lives of these children and to provide support to families who are struggling to care for their children.\n\nRowling recounts how she was inspired to start Lumos after seeing a photograph of a child locked in a caged bed in a residential institution. She was shocked by the conditions and the fact that the child was being held captive. She began writing letters to influential people and eventually established Lumos.\n\nThe charity has made significant progress in several countries, including Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. In Moldova, there has been a 70% reduction in the number of children in institutions since Lumos began working there. In the Czech Republic, there has been a 75% fall in admissions to institutions in Lumos's demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has reduced by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nRowling emphasizes that the solution to the problem of institutionalization is not to improve the conditions in institutions, but to eliminate them altogether. She argues that it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution, and that this also reduces long-term costs.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and Rowling is committed to making this a reality. She has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage people to get involved.\n\nRowling's message is clear: the institutionalization of children is a solvable problem, and it is up to all of us to make a difference.

This agreement was made in a joint statement and is seen as a step towards improving relations between the two countries. The agreement comes after a unilateral operation by the US in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden, which caused outrage in Pakistan. US Senator John Kerry visited Pakistan and met with Pakistani leaders to discuss the relationship between the two countries. Kerry said that the US and Pakistan will cooperate in operations against \"high-value targets\" in Pakistan and that the two countries will increase intelligence sharing and joint operations. Kerry also announced that Pakistan had agreed to return the tail of a US military helicopter that was damaged during the bin Laden raid. The handover of the helicopter tail is seen as a sign of goodwill and a step towards improving relations between the two countries. Kerry said that the relationship between the US and Pakistan is \"make-or-break\" and that actions, not words, are needed to earn the votes of members of Congress who are skeptical of the relationship. The US and Pakistan have a complex relationship, with the US relying on Pakistan as a key supply route for troops in Afghanistan and Pakistan relying on US assistance to arm its military and shore up its economy. The relationship has been strained in recent months, with Pakistan passing a resolution condemning the bin Laden raid and threatening to cut off NATO supply routes through Pakistan.

Kim Jong-nam was poisoned with a highly toxic nerve agent, VX, at Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13. The Malaysian police have confirmed that the substance was detected on Kim's eyes and face, and one of the two women accused of wiping the toxin on Kim's face was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. The police are still investigating how the lethal agent entered Malaysia.\n\nNorth Korea has denied any involvement in the death of Kim Jong-nam, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence and having \"sinister\" purposes. However, Malaysia has accused North Korea of being responsible for the attack, and has sought the extradition of several North Korean officials, including the second secretary of the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe use of VX nerve agent has raised concerns about public safety in the airport, which was not decontaminated for 11 days after the attack. The nerve agent can remain lethal for a long period of time and can be absorbed into the body through skin contact, inhalation, ingestion, or eye contact. The Malaysian authorities have said that they are decontaminating the airport and areas where the suspects are known to have visited.\n\nThe case has also raised questions about the capabilities of North Korea's chemical weapons program. North Korea is believed to have the third largest stockpile of chemical weapons, after the US and Russia, and is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin, and V-type chemical agents, including VX. The country is believed to have the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis.\n\nThe death of Kim Jong-nam has also sparked concerns about the safety of the airport and the potential for further attacks. The Malaysian authorities have said that they are taking steps to ensure the safety of passengers and staff, but the incident has highlighted the need for greater vigilance and cooperation between countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons.\n\nIn related news, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three people in 1994 and 1995, one of whom died.

He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated.

However, the test revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, and doctors told her that the baby would be deaf, blind, and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery. \n\nDavis sought opinions from multiple doctors, who all agreed that the baby would suffer if born.

The skeleton was discovered lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. The team from the University of Reading, who made the discovery, will conduct scientific analysis to determine the gender of the child, its diet, and date of burial. This discovery is part of a three-year dig in the Vale of Pewsey, a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council, and Wiltshire Museum. The aim of the dig is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge.\n\nIn addition to the skeleton, the team has also uncovered several other significant finds, including flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. These finds were discovered at Marden henge, a prehistoric monument built in 2,400 BC and believed to be the largest of its kind in the country. The team has also discovered a rectangular building at Marden henge, which is believed to be one of the best-preserved buildings from the period ever found in the UK. The building is thought to have been used for gatherings and feasts, and the team has found evidence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit.\n\nThe team is led by Dr Jim Leary, director of the excavation, who believes that Marden henge was used for status and to show off wealth and power. The site is vast, with ramparts three meters high and a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 meters tall. The team will continue to work on the site for years to come, and the public will have the opportunity to visit the site and see the finds on display.\n\nOverall, these discoveries are significant not only for the insights they provide into the lives of people who lived in the area thousands of years ago but also for the understanding of the prehistoric monuments and landscapes of the region.

Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now.

So far he's found the remains of a 4,000-year-old teen wearing an amber necklace just outside Marden Henge, per the BBC; fancy arrowheads; and a stone building within the henge containing the bones of at least 13 pigs, suggesting a huge feast was held there. \"For all the attention that has been lavished on Stonehenge over the years, we may well find out that Marden was where it was really at during the Neolithic,\" he says.

The opposition was led by Glass Lewis, a leading shareholder advisory group, which recommended that shareholders vote against the payment plans. The group criticized the company's decision to award Chief Executive Bob Dudley a 20% increase in his total remuneration package to $19.6 million, citing the company's poor performance last year.\n\nOn April 14, 2016, the company's shareholders voted on the matter at the company's annual general meeting in London. The preliminary results showed that 59% of investors voting by proxy rejected the company's executive compensation decisions for 2015, including Dudley's pay increase. This was the first time that a top British company was defeated over executive pay since shareholders at advertising group WPP and Xstrata, the mining company, rebelled four years ago during what was dubbed the \"shareholder spring\".\n\nThe opposition to Dudley's pay increase was not limited to Glass Lewis. Other institutional investors, including Aberdeen Asset Management and Royal London Asset Management, also criticized the pay deal, branding it \"simply too high\". The Institute of Directors said the shareholder rebellion would \"determine the future of corporate governance in the UK\".\n\nBP's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, defended the pay package, saying that it was based on \"exceptional\" company performance during a difficult year. However, he also promised to review the terms on which pay is awarded in consultation with shareholders before next year. The company's spokesman said that shareholders had previously backed the pay formula, which was approved in 2014 by 96% of shareholders.\n\nThe opposition to Dudley's pay increase was not limited to the company's shareholders. Experts also pointed out that the pay package was not justified by the company's performance last year. Mark Freebairn, partner at recruitment firm Odgers Berndtson, said that if Dudley was to leave BP, it would be for a competitive company and remuneration would be part of the discussion. He also pointed out that BP was now in a far better position than when Dudley took the helm.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition to Dudley's pay increase was a significant setback for the company, and it remains to be seen how the company will respond to the criticism.

The legend, known as the Pishtacos, tells the story of mythical killers who roam the Andes mountains extracting fat from travelers. According to Felix, the gang murdered up to 60 people and exported their fat for thousands of dollars a liter to Italian cosmetics makers. However, police in Lima, the capital, later admitted that the investigation had been botched and that there may have been only one victim. The police in Huanuco, where the alleged crimes took place, said that the four alleged killers may have bottled the victim's fat to intimidate their rivals in an area rife with drug trafficking and violence. The police have been harshly criticized for their handling of the case, with anthropologists saying that they foolishly believed the Pishtacos legend when searching for a motive for the murder, and then played on people's fears by turning the legend into reality. Medical experts have also dismissed the theory that human fat has monetary value, saying that it would be pointless to kill people to harvest their fat when it could be easily collected from plastic surgery clinics that perform tummy tucks. The case has also sparked concerns about the police's reputation and the impact on tourism in Peru. The police chief, Miguel Hidalgo, has apologized for the embarrassment caused by the case and has put Felix on indefinite leave from his job.

{"pred": " \nThe Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) has seen a significant increase in hikers in recent years, thanks in part to the popularity of Cheryl Strayed’s memoir “Wild” and the subsequent movie adaptation. The PCTA has reported a 300% increase in website traffic and a surge in requests for permits for long-distance hikes on the trail. In 2016, more than 4,000 long-distance hiking permits have been issued, with over 3,000 of those permits being for hikers attempting the full Northbound thru-hike.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has raised concerns about overcrowding and the potential for environmental damage. The PCTA has implemented a quota system, limiting the number of permits issued per day to 50, in an effort to mitigate the impact on the trail and surrounding ecosystems. However, this system has not been without its challenges, with some hikers feeling that the honor system is not being respected and that the trail is becoming increasingly crowded.\n\nDespite the challenges, many hikers continue to be drawn to the PCT, citing its transformative power and the sense of community that comes with hiking the trail. The PCTA has launched a campaign, #responsiblywild, to promote safety and “leave no trace” practices among hikers. The campaign aims to encourage hikers to be mindful of their impact on the environment and to take steps to minimize their footprint.\n\nIn addition to the PCT, other long-distance hiking trails, such as the Appalachian Trail, are also experiencing increased popularity. The movie “A Walk in the Woods,” based on Bill Bryson’s book, is set to be released later this year and is expected to further boost interest in long-distance hiking.\n\nOverall, the increased popularity of the PCT and other long-distance hiking trails has raised concerns about overcrowding and environmental impact.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage.

Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called.

{"pred": " \nA recent study published in the American Medical Association journal JAMA Pediatrics has found that pregnant women who frequently take acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol, may be at a higher risk of having children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and similar disorders. The study, which analyzed data from over 64,000 children in Denmark, found that women who took acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy were more likely to have children with ADHD-like behaviors. However, the study's authors emphasized that the findings do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Beate Ritz, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that pregnant women should not worry about the findings, but rather try to avoid taking painkillers as much as possible until more research is done. Ritz noted that the study found that taking acetaminophen for longer periods and later in pregnancy was associated with higher risks, and that more than half of all mothers in the study reported some acetaminophen use while pregnant.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked concerns about the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy, with some experts warning that the drug may interfere with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development. However, other experts have pointed out that the study's results are not conclusive and that more research is needed to fully understand the relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that acetaminophen may increase the risk of ADHD by interfering with maternal hormones that are critical for fetal brain development, citing a previous study done using acetaminophen in rats and a study of acetaminophen and autism done with humans. However, other experts have questioned the relevance of these studies to the human condition.\n\nIn response to the study's findings, the maker of Tylenol, McNeil Consumer Healthcare, said that the drug has a favorable safety profile when used as directed, and that there are no prospective, randomized controlled studies demonstrating a causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and adverse effects on child development.\n\nOverall, the study highlights the importance of not taking a drug's safety during pregnancy for granted, and the need for more research to fully understand the relationship between acetaminophen use and ADHD.

{"pred": " \n\nThe Lovely Bones, a film adaptation of Alice Sebold's bestselling novel, has been released. The movie, directed by Peter Jackson, tells the story of Susie Salmon, a 14-year-old girl who is murdered by her neighbor, George Harvey. The film follows Susie's journey from her death to her afterlife, where she watches over her family and tries to help them find her killer.\n\nThe movie has received mixed reviews from critics. Some have praised the film's visuals and the performances of the cast, particularly Saoirse Ronan, who plays Susie. However, others have criticized the film's tone, which they feel is inconsistent and veers between lightheartedness and heavy-handedness.\n\nOne of the main criticisms of the film is its handling of the novel's themes. The book is known for its exploration of the complexities of human relationships and the power of sex, but the film shies away from these themes in favor of a more surface-level portrayal of grief and loss.\n\nThe film's visuals have also been a point of contention. The movie's depiction of heaven, which is meant to be a fantastical and dreamlike place, has been criticized for being cheesy and unoriginal. The film's use of computer-generated imagery has been praised, but some have felt that it detracts from the overall impact of the story.\n\nDespite these criticisms, the film has its moments. Saoirse Ronan's performance as Susie is particularly noteworthy, and Stanley Tucci's portrayal of George Harvey is chilling and unsettling. The film's thriller scenes are also well-executed, and the tension between Susie's family and her killer is palpable.\n\nOverall, The Lovely Bones is a film that is both captivating and frustrating. While it has its moments of beauty and emotion, it also feels like a missed opportunity to explore the complexities of the novel. With a more nuanced approach to its themes and a more original take on its visuals, the film could have been something truly special. As it stands, it is a film that is worth watching, but not necessarily one that will leave a lasting impression.\n\nRating: 3/5 stars\n\nRecommendation: If you are a fan of Peter Jackson's work or are interested in the novel, then The Lovely Bones is worth watching.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

{"pred": " \nThe recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have raised concerns about the security of customer information. According to reports, Neiman Marcus was hacked as far back as July, but the breach was not fully contained until January 1st. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying it first learned in mid-December of suspicious activity that involved credit cards used at its stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner and has offered customers one free year of credit monitoring.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target was also hacked, resulting in the theft of credit and debit card data for over 100 million customers. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for millions of customers. The report details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective, and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.\n\nThe report suggests that the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it, unencrypted. The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\"\n\nThe report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach. The authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches.\n\nThe report also suggests that the data breach was part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report offers some of the first details to emerge about the source of the attack that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts and other personal information belonging to 70 million people. The authorities are still investigating the source of the attack, but it is believed to have originated from Eastern Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent data breaches at Neiman Marcus and Target have highlighted the need for retailers to improve their security measures to protect customer information. The use of malware and other sophisticated hacking techniques has made it easier for cyber crooks to steal sensitive information, and it is likely that we will see more of this type of breach in the future.

In Kenya, a 13-year-old lion named Mohawk was shot dead by wildlife rangers after it attacked a man in a crowd. The lion had escaped from Nairobi National Park and was surrounded by hundreds of bystanders. The rangers claimed that they had no choice but to kill the lion as it posed an immediate threat to human life. However, many Kenyans have expressed outrage and disappointment over the decision, with some calling for the rangers to have used tranquilizers instead.\n\nThe incident has sparked a debate over the balance between protecting people and conserving lions. The Kenya Wildlife Service has said that the lion's escape was due to a faulty electrical fence, which allowed it to slip out of the park. However, conservationists have pointed out that habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict are major reasons for the surge in lion escapes.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester has escaped from a national park in South Africa. Wildlife officials have vowed to put him down once they capture him, prompting a Twitter hashtag #SaveSylvester and an online petition to rescue the big cat. This is not the first time Sylvester has strayed away from the park.\n\nThe incidents have highlighted the challenges faced by wildlife officials in balancing the needs of humans and animals. In Kenya, the Nairobi National Park is home to endangered black rhinos, lions, leopards, cheetahs, giraffes, and diverse birdlife. However, the park is under growing pressure as the city expands, and the infrastructure projects have disturbed the lions, causing them to leave the park.\n\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature considers the African lion a \"vulnerable\" species, with its population having declined by 50 percent in the past 20 years. The study has highlighted the need for conservation efforts to protect the species.\n\nIn conclusion, the incidents involving lions in Kenya and South Africa have raised concerns over the balance between protecting people and conserving lions.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

The vessel, which is less than an inch long, is decorated with crosses and is believed to have been used as a reliquary in the sixth century C.E. The discovery was made in a reliquary that dates to the sixth century C.E. and is named for Saint John the Theologian, who is considered one of Jesus' apostles.\n\nThe team also uncovered a 10th century Bulgarian royal seal at the fortress site. Nikolov described the discovery of the reliquary as \"one of the most important discoveries\" in the museum's history. The lead tube reliquary is unique in that it contains images of a cross with equal arms inside a medallion and two overlapping crosses with equal arms, which are identical to images found on clay tube reliquaries produced in ancient Ephesus.\n\nThe discovery is significant because it provides evidence of the early Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Lands, which was a common practice among Christians in the sixth century C.E.

Mike Brown, a Caltech astronomer, and his team have discovered evidence of a massive planet, dubbed Planet Nine, which is thought to be about five times the size of Earth and orbiting the sun at a distance of about 200 astronomical units (AU). The team's research, published in the Astronomical Journal, suggests that Planet Nine is a gas giant, similar to Neptune, and is responsible for the unusual motion of several small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nBrown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in demoting Pluto from its status as a planet in 2006, says that he and his team have been searching for Planet Nine for years and are confident that it exists. They have used mathematical modeling and observations of the motion of small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system to infer the existence of the planet.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system and the formation of planets. It suggests that there may be many more planets in the solar system that have not yet been discovered, and that the solar system may be more complex and dynamic than previously thought.\n\nBrown and his team are now searching for Planet Nine using powerful telescopes, and they hope to detect it within the next five years. If they are successful, it will be a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and will provide new insights into the formation and evolution of the solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked renewed debate about the definition of a planet. Some scientists argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, while others argue that it should remain a dwarf planet. Brown, however, is confident that Planet Nine will be recognized as a planet and will provide a new and exciting area of study for astronomers.\n\nIn related news, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in July, providing new insights into the dwarf planet's composition and geology. The mission has sparked renewed interest in Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies and small celestial objects beyond Neptune.\n\nOverall, the discovery of Planet Nine is a major breakthrough in the field of astronomy and has significant implications for our understanding of the solar system and the formation of planets.

Cholesterol-containing deposits (plaque) in the arteries and inflammation are usually to blame for coronary artery disease. When plaque builds up, it narrows the coronary arteries, decreasing blood flow to the heart, which can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, or other coronary artery disease signs and symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack.\n\nA new study suggests that rapidly losing and regaining weight, or “yo-yo” dieting, may increase the risk for deadly heart attacks and strokes in people with coronary artery disease. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest changes in body weight had a 78 percent higher risk of new onset diabetes, a 117 percent higher risk of heart attack, a 136 percent higher risk of stroke, and a 124 percent higher risk of death compared to those who experienced the smallest body weight changes.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, notes that it's essential to lose weight, but it's also crucial to keep it off. He suggests that the findings may be used as motivation to keep the weight off. The study was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nCoronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, killing over 370,000 people each year. The condition is characterized by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries, which can lead to angina or heart attack.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with increased risk of poor heart health. The researchers found that people with coronary heart disease who had experienced large fluctuations in weight over an average of 4.7 years were at much higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death than people who experienced little change in body weight.\n\nThe study's results raise concerns about weight fluctuation in people with coronary heart disease and suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the relationship between yo-yo dieting and increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and death.

The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

Meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a dire weather forecast, warning of a powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength. The forecast predicted catastrophic damage, including roof and wall failure, and water shortages. Ricks' forecast was validated by his local expertise and his own experience of previous hurricanes. Despite his efforts, the response to the disaster was inadequate, and Ricks was heartbroken by the devastation. The forecast is now on display at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. Ricks'", "answers": ["It's one of the most famous weather forecasts of the modern era, and it came out exactly 13 years ago to the day. That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks…perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure. All gabled roofs will fail…leaving those homes severely damaged or destroyed.\" And this: \"Water shortages will make human suffering incredible by modern standards.\" (Spann's tweet includes the full text.) The forecast has been credited with saving lives, and it is now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, as noted by Slate on the 10-year anniversary. Ricks told Brian Williams of NBC News on Sept. 15, 2005, that he went through the warning line by line to verify each doomsday-sounding statement before making it public. He ended up removing nothing. \"I would much rather have been wrong in this one,\" he told Williams. \"I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, 'Hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one.'\" (Read about what JJ Watt's crowdsourced fundraiser accomplished in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1046}

According to a recent study, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This trend is raising concerns among medical professionals, who are urging the medical community to be more vigilant in screening for the disease in younger patients. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer, but they also lived slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment. \n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized that colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly, but this study is a \"wake-up call\" to the medical community that a significant number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50. She noted that younger patients are often diagnosed only after their cancers start to cause symptoms, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon. \n\nDoctors are being urged to be on the lookout for warning signs of colon cancer, such as dark blood or blood mixed with stool, which can indicate the presence of the disease. People with a family history of colon cancer and those who are at higher risk should begin screening earlier than the age of 50, according to Dr. Hendren. \n\nHowever, some experts are cautioning that it is too soon to say whether colon cancer screening guidelines should be altered to reflect the trend of increasing cases among younger patients.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": " \nArchaeologists have made a groundbreaking discovery in the Flinders Ranges of South Australia, uncovering evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years. The site, known as Warratyi, is located about 550 kilometers north of Adelaide and contains a treasure trove of artefacts and fossils, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone tools, and the remains of extinct megafauna. The discovery pushes back the known dates of human settlement in the arid interior of Australia by around 10,000 years and suggests that humans were able to migrate south quickly, contradicting previous assumptions that the arid centre was a barrier to movement.\n\nThe site was discovered by archaeologist Giles Hamm, who was surveying the area with local elder Clifford Coulthard. Hamm said that the discovery was a chance find, and that the team had no idea how significant it was at the time. The team has recovered over 4,300 artefacts and 200 bone fragments from the site, including the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human migration and settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans were able to develop complex technologies and adapt to the harsh environment of the arid interior, and that they were able to interact with and hunt megafauna. The site also provides evidence of the use of hafted axe technology, which is significant because it was previously thought to have been developed later.\n\nThe discovery has been met with excitement and controversy in the archaeological community, with some experts questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used. However, the team behind the discovery is confident in their findings and believes that the site provides a unique window into the lives of early Australians.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi is a significant milestone in the study of human migration and settlement in Australia, and it has the potential to rewrite our understanding of the history of the continent. It highlights the ingenuity and adaptability of the first Australians and provides a fascinating glimpse into the lives of our ancestors.\n\nThe site is now being studied further, and the team is working to learn more about the people who lived there and the technologies they developed. The discovery of Warratyi is a testament to the importance of collaboration between archaeologists, indigenous communities, and other stakeholders in the study of our shared history.\n\nThe discovery of Warratyi has also sparked debate about the extinction of megafauna in Australia. The site contains the remains of extinct megafauna, including the Diprotodon", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

{"pred": " \nThe universe is expanding at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, which will eventually leave all stars beyond our Local Group inaccessible. Astrophysicist Dan Hooper proposed that advanced civilizations would capture stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible, and use them to accelerate their civilization's growth. This would be done by creating a swarm of satellites, known as Dyson spheres, which would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet. Hooper suggested that these civilizations would be able to detect the unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their useful stars harvested. However, humans do not have the precise instruments yet to detect these signatures.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and was later popularized by science fiction authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven. Dyson spheres are hypothetical megastructures that would be made up of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, which would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the home planet. These structures would be detectable as infrared radiation, and would be a sign of an advanced civilization.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres is part of a larger concept known as the Kardashev scale, which was proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The Kardashev scale is a way to measure the energy consumption of a civilization, and is divided into three types: Type I, which harnesses all the resources of a planet; Type II, which harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Type III, which harnesses all the resources of a galaxy. Humans are currently at a level of about 0.7 on the scale, and would need to reach Type II in a few thousand years and Type III in a few hundred thousand to a million years.\n\nOverall, the idea of Dyson spheres and the Kardashev scale is a way to think about the potential for advanced civilizations to harness energy from their environment, and to detect signs of their existence. While we do not have the technology yet to detect these signatures, the idea of Dyson spheres is an interesting and thought-provoking concept that challenges our understanding of the universe and our place in it. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it is not a single paragraph.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Excavations at the Olorgesailie Basin have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and cultural practices around 320,000 years ago. The findings, published in three papers in the journal Science, suggest that early humans in the region were able to adapt to changing environments and develop more complex social networks.\n\nThe oldest stone tools discovered at the site date back to 1.2 million years ago and are characteristic of the Acheulian culture of the Early Stone Age. However, around 320,000 years ago, a new technology emerged, marked by the use of smaller, more specialized tools made from obsidian and other exotic materials. These tools were likely used for hunting and gathering, and the discovery of pigment and other materials suggests that early humans were able to exchange goods and ideas over long distances.\n\nThe researchers believe that this shift in technology and culture was driven by climate change and the need for early humans to adapt to a more unpredictable environment. The findings suggest that early humans were able to develop complex social networks and exchange goods and ideas over long distances, laying the groundwork for the development of modern human behavior.\n\nThe discoveries also challenge the long-held view that modern human behavior emerged around 40,000-50,000 years ago with the \"human revolution.\" Instead, the evidence suggests that complex behaviors and technological innovations were present in Africa much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

Trump tweeted the video with the hashtags \"#FraudNewsCNN\" and \"#FNN.\" A CNN spokesman called it \"a sad day when the president of the United States encourages violence against reporters.\" But on ABC News, Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert suggested CNN and other critics were overreacting. \"No one would perceive that as a threat,\" he said, adding that Trump is \"beaten up in a way on cable platforms that he has a right to respond to.\" The new video comes just a few days after Trump posted two tweets in which he talked about MSNBC's Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski \"bleeding badly from a face-lift.\" Those tweets sparked condemnation from all over the political spectrum, with even Trump's fellow Republicans calling them unpresidential.

However, this explanation was met with ridicule on Twitter, with many calling it \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" and \"stupidity.\" \n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has been criticized for being unnecessary, as there is no technological excuse for it.

The price of the AirPods is $159, and many have questioned the value of paying such a high price for a product that can be easily lost. \n\nThe removal of the headphone jack has also been seen as a move to further Apple's walled garden approach, where users are forced to use Apple-approved accessories and services.

Activists have been protesting the move, with some even resorting to civil disobedience, including blocking trucks from leaving the offices of Homrich, a company contracted by DWSD to carry out the shut-offs. At least nine activists were arrested during a protest on Thursday, with more expected in the coming weeks.\n\nThe DWSD claims that it needs to shut off water services to recoup $175 million in outstanding bills, but critics argue that the department is unfairly targeting low-income residents while ignoring large commercial entities that owe millions of dollars.

They point out that in a city with a poverty rate of 44 percent, shutting off water services is a human rights violation. The U.N. has even gotten involved, with a panel calling the water shutoffs a violation of human rights and urging the DWSD to reconnect households that have been disconnected.\n\nIn response to the criticism, the DWSD has announced a $1 million fund to help low-income customers avoid shutoffs, but activists say it's not enough and that many others are likely to lose access to water over the summer.

Simpson's lawyer, Yale Galanter, believes that his client deserves parole and that the Las Vegas jury that convicted him was motivated by a desire for payback for Simpson's 2007 book, \"If I Did It.\" The parole board will consider Simpson's behavior in prison, as well as his age, in making their decision. Simpson has been a model prisoner and has expressed remorse for his actions, but some critics argue that he has not taken sufficient responsibility for his crimes. The outcome of the parole hearing is uncertain, but Simpson's release from prison could have significant implications for his personal life and his relationship with the public. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it is not a single paragraph.

Thursday's hearing will cover four concurrent sentences for use of a deadly weapon and two consecutive sentences for assault with a deadly weapon, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Four board members will vote after the hearing and Simpson could be free by Oct. 1 if they are all in favor of parole. If Simpson is indeed released this fall—which appears almost certainly to be the decision—it will \"renew the rabid curiosity\" in the case and \"produce a spectacle unlike anything we’ve seen since he went behind bars,\" Nancy Armour at USA Today predicts. There has even been talk that Simpson might end up with a reality TV show, but Armour wants Simpson to avoid the spotlight unless he wants to return to the \"toxic mentality that landed him in prison in the first place.\" If the former NFL star does end up with a TV show, the money is likely to go to the families of murder victims Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, CBS News reports.

{"pred": " \n\nJamaica has made a significant step towards decriminalizing marijuana by passing a law that reduces possession of small quantities to a petty offence. The law, which was passed by the Jamaican parliament, makes possession of up to 2 ounces (56.6g) of marijuana a non-arrestable offence that can result in a fine. The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes.\n\nThe law is a significant step forward for Jamaica, which has long been associated with marijuana culture. The drug has been a part of Jamaican culture for decades, and the law change is seen as a way to correct decades of criminalizing tens of thousands of Jamaicans, mostly poor young black males, for possession of a little \"spliff\".\n\nThe law also paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The Jamaican government hopes that the island can become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry, health tourism, and the development of innovative pot-derived items.\n\nThe law change is also seen as a victory for religious freedom, as Rastafarians can now freely use marijuana for sacramental purposes. The law also allows tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad to apply for permits to legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed.\n\nThe law change is part of an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana, and several states have legalized personal use. Uruguay has also become the first nation to create a legal marijuana market.\n\nThe Jamaican government has stated that the law change does not mean that they plan to soften their stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The security forces will continue to rigorously enforce Jamaican law consistent with international treaty obligations.\n\nThe law change has been welcomed by cannabis crusaders, who see it as a big step in the right direction. However, there is still a lot of work to be done to refine the details of the licensing authority and the medical marijuana sector.\n\nOverall, the law change is a significant step forward for Jamaica and the international community, and it marks a new era in the country's relationship with marijuana. \n\nWord Count: 400 words. \n\nNote: The summary is written in a neutral tone and does not include any personal opinions or biases.

A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It is a legal procedure that prevents the government from holding individuals indefinitely without showing cause. The Founders of the United States enshrined it in the first article of the Constitution, considering it a fundamental right that ensures the executive branch cannot hold people without cause. However, in 2006, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) revoked the right to habeas corpus for individuals detained at Guantanamo Bay and labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the U.S. as well, potentially allowing the government to detain individuals without legal recourse.\n\nThe MCA has eroded the foundation of the U.S. legal and constitutional framework, compromising the core legal value of habeas corpus. The government has little evidence against most Guantanamo detainees, with many being sold into captivity by warlords for bounties. Despite legal victories affirming the detainees' right to challenge their detention, the Bush administration has prevented them from getting a fair hearing in the courts.\n\nIn a separate development, a New York judge has granted a pair of research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, potentially recognizing them as legal persons. The ruling could force the university to release the primates and sway additional judges to do the same with other research animals.\n\nThe Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, sees this as a major step forward in their efforts to secure the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals. While some experts caution against reading too much into the ruling, the group plans to use the habeas corpus ruling to sway judges in other jurisdictions and file additional cases involving other animals, including research animals.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of habeas corpus remains a vital aspect of Western law, ensuring that individuals are not held indefinitely without cause. However, the MCA has compromised this right, and the government's treatment of Guantanamo detainees raises concerns about the erosion of the U.S. legal and constitutional framework.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps.

{"pred": " \nScientists have made significant discoveries about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once a warm and wet world with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its surface. The ocean, which was at least a mile deep in some areas, lasted for millions of years and was a major factor in the planet's habitability. The discovery was made by analyzing the Martian atmosphere and finding that it contains a high concentration of deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen, which is a sign of water loss over time.\n\nAccording to NASA scientists, the ocean covered about 20% of the planet's surface, which is similar to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. The water was likely pooled in the northern hemisphere, which has a lower altitude, and was deep enough to cover the entire surface of the planet to a depth of 137 meters.\n\nThe scientists used infrared maps to study the Martian atmosphere and found that the water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars lost a vast amount of water in the past. They calculated that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137 meters.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The presence of a large ocean in the past suggests that the planet was habitable for a long time, and the conditions were likely suitable for life to emerge and thrive. The search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's Exomars rover, which will be sent to the planet in 2018 to search for chemical signatures of life.\n\nThe scientists also found that the ordinary hydrogen in the Martian atmosphere has been gradually leaking into outer space, which has led to a higher proportion of deuterium in the water. This has allowed them to estimate the amount of water that once existed on the planet, which was likely much larger than the minimum amount calculated.\n\nOverall, the discovery of a massive ocean on Mars in the past has significant implications for our understanding of the planet's history and its potential for supporting life. The evidence continues to mount that Mars was once a warm and wet world, and the conditions were likely suitable for life to emerge and thrive. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it may not fit in a single page depending on the font size and margins. \n\nReferences:\n1.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Jumaah, a member of the Yazidi minority, had fled to Iraq to be with his family after Isis fighters took over the next-door village, killing all the men and taking the women into slavery. Turner, who was not willing to leave her student to die without trying to do something, contacted the university's security chief Per Gustafson, who arranged a rescue operation with a security company. Over a few days of intense activity, two Landcruisers carrying four heavily-armed mercenaries roared into the area where Jumaah was hiding and sped him away to Erbil Airport together with his wife and two small children. The family was eventually reunited in Sweden, where Jumaah completed his PhD and now works for a pharmaceuticals company in Malmö. The family has almost finished paying the university back for the rescue operation. This unique event was the first time a university had been involved in a rescue operation of this kind. \n\nThe rescue operation was a result of Turner's determination to help her student and his family, who were facing a life-and-death situation. Turner's actions were motivated by her desire to protect her student and his family from the brutal Isis fighters. The rescue operation was a success, and Jumaah and his family were able to escape the war zone and start a new life in Sweden. \n\nThis story highlights the importance of human connection and the impact that one person can have on another's life.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": " \nThe roar of the T. rex has been a staple of popular culture for decades, but new research suggests that the mighty dinosaur may not have sounded anything like the iconic roar we've come to associate with it. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T. rex and other dinosaurs may have made sounds more similar to those of birds, such as pigeons or ostriches, rather than the loud, mammalian screams we're used to hearing in movies.\n\nThe study, which analyzed the vocalizations of over 200 bird species, found that a quarter of them make \"closed-mouth\" sounds, which are low, throaty whooshes of air produced by a flesh sac called an esophageal pouch. This type of sound is thought to have evolved independently in different groups of animals, including birds and crocodiles, and may have been used for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nThe researchers suggest that large-bodied dinosaurs, such as the T. rex, may have had similar vocal abilities, and that their sounds may have been similar to those of modern birds. This is in contrast to the loud, mammalian screams often depicted in movies, which are thought to be the result of a combination of animal sounds, including baby elephant cries, tiger chuffs, and alligator gargles.\n\nThe study's findings are based on the analysis of bird vocalizations, but the researchers believe that they may also shed light on how dinosaurs made sound. Since birds descended from dinosaurs, the study's results may provide clues about the vocalizations of extinct dinosaurs.\n\nIn related news, sound designer Gary Rydstrom has revealed the secrets behind the iconic sounds of the Jurassic Park dinosaurs. Rydstrom, who won two Academy Awards for his work on the film, used a combination of animal sounds, including tortoise mating calls, horse breathing, and donkey yodeling, to create the distinctive voices of the T. rex, Velociraptors, and other dinosaurs.\n\nRydstrom's use of animal sounds was not limited to the dinosaurs themselves, but also extended to the sounds of their environments. For example, the sound of the Gallimimus herd was created by recording the sounds of a horse stampede, while the sound of the Brachiosaurus's singing was made by slowing down a donkey's braying.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalizations, and may also provide clues about the sounds made by extinct dinosaurs.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

A total lunar eclipse, also known as a \"blood moon,\" will occur during a blue moon, which is the second full moon of the month. This event is special because it is the first total eclipse of a blue moon in nearly 152 years. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America. The moon will slowly lose its brightness and take on a reddish hue during the eclipse.\n\nThe event is also a supermoon, which is a full moon that appears when the moon is at its closest orbital point to Earth. This will make the moon appear 14% bigger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon. The supermoon will be visible on January 1 and 31, 2018, making it a rare occurrence to have three supermoons in a row.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project will provide a livestream of the eclipse from Australia, starting at 11:30am UTC. The project will also show the supermoon rising above Rome's skyline on January 1, starting at 4:00pm UTC.\n\nTo view the supermoon or the lunar eclipse, you don't need special glasses. The event is safe to view with the naked eye. However, if you want to take a picture of the event, you can use a smartphone or a DSLR camera. NASA recommends using the daylight white balance and adjusting the exposure slider to get the right balance of light for your shot.\n\nThe event is a rare opportunity to see a total lunar eclipse and a supermoon. It is recommended to wake up early to catch the partial eclipse, which will begin at 11:48am UTC on January 31. The eclipse will reach its maximum at 1:30pm UTC.

Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
