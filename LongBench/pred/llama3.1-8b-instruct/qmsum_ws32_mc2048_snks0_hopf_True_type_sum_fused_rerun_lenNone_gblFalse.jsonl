{"pred": " Kirsty Williams stated that there was a trend of teacher recruiting, with only 65% of priority places filled in Welsh training centers, and that this was a problem that was not unique to Wales, but a global issue. She attributed the reasons for this trend to a lack of financial incentives, despite offering £20,000 to graduates, and that the issue was not just about ITE (Initial Teacher Education) but also about employment-based routes into teaching.

Second, they had looked at financial incentives.Third, they were embarking on their first national ITE recruitment marketing exercise.

The Industrial Designer also mentioned that the push-button requires a simple chip, the scroll wheel requires a regular chip, and the LCD display requires an advanced chip, which is more expensive. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to look into the cost difference between the LCD display and the regular chip. The team decided to make two concepts, one with an LCD display and one without, to compare the costs and usability. The Industrial Designer suggested using a joystick instead of a scroll wheel to make the remote control more user-friendly and easier to use. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to come up with a design that incorporates a joystick and an LCD display, and to make sure it is not too expensive. The team also discussed the use of a normal battery, a kinetic battery, or a rechargeable battery, with the Industrial Designer suggesting that a normal battery is the cheapest option.
