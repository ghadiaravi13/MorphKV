The letter, written in May 2012, was published in the Russian newspaper Izvestia. In the letter, Kalashnikov described his spiritual pain and asked if he was to blame for the deaths caused by his rifle. He also expressed his regret for the use of his invention by terrorists and child soldiers. Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 during World War II, when he was wounded and saw the need for a reliable and simple rifle. He received many Russian state honors for his invention, but made little money from it. Kalashnikov was baptized at the age of 91 and became a devout Christian, which is a significant change from his earlier life as an atheist. The Russian Orthodox Church has responded to Kalashnikov's letter, saying that the Church supports the use of weapons for defense, but not for terrorism. Kalashnikov's funeral was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he was buried in Moscow. The AK-47 has become one of the most widely used and recognizable firearms in the world, with over 100 million units sold.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has revealed another alarming consequence: it fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, cigarette smoke makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics, making it a more formidable foe in the fight against infectious diseases.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, discovered that cigarette smoke alters the structure of MRSA, making it more resistant to the human immune system. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke became more aggressive and harder to kill, even after 24 hours. This is a significant concern, as MRSA is a life-threatening infection that can cause pneumonia, skin infections, and bloodstream infections.\n\nThe study also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA were dose-dependent, meaning that the more cigarette smoke the bacteria were exposed to, the more resistant they became. This suggests that even occasional smoking can have a significant impact on the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Infection and Immunity found that e-cigarette vapor also made MRSA more resistant to antibiotics, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke. This suggests that e-cigarettes may not be a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes when it comes to the risk of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nThe findings of these studies have significant implications for public health. Cigarette smoking is already a major risk factor for infectious diseases, and the discovery that it also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics adds another layer of complexity to the issue. The study's authors hope that their findings will contribute to a greater understanding of the relationship between cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and ultimately lead to the development of new strategies for preventing and treating these infections.\n\nIn conclusion, the research highlights the need for smokers to quit and for healthcare professionals to be aware of the risks associated with cigarette smoke and antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

Using this method, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the world, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nHowever, a similar study by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, published in a different article, found that Carl Linnaeus was the most influential thinker in the world. This study used a different method to analyze the links between Wikipedia articles and found that Linnaeus was at the center of a large web of links, with many other articles referencing his work.\n\nThe study's authors noted that Linnaeus' influence was due to his work in taxonomy, which led to many species being named after him.

She believes that with the right support and resources, families can care for their children, and that institutionalization is not necessary.\n\nLumos estimates that the institutionalization of children can be eradicated globally by 2050, and Rowling is committed to making this a reality. She has launched a social media campaign, #Letstalklumos, to raise awareness about the issue and to encourage people to take action.\n\nRowling's passion and dedication to this cause are inspiring, and her work with Lumos has made a significant impact on the lives of thousands of children.

The shareholders voted against the company's executive pay package, with 59% of the votes cast against the proposal. This is a significant rebuke to the company's CEO, Bob Dudley, and the board of directors. The vote was non-binding, but it is a clear indication of the growing discontent among investors over executive pay.\n\nThe company's executive pay package was criticized for being too generous, particularly in light of the company's poor performance in 2015. The company made a loss of $6.5 billion in 2015, and its share price has fallen by over 50% in the past year. Despite this, the company's CEO, Bob Dudley, received a pay package worth over $20 million.\n\nThe shareholders' rebellion against BP's executive pay package is part of a growing trend of investors pushing back against high executive pay. In recent years, there have been several high-profile cases of investors rebelling against executive pay packages, including at companies such as Royal Dutch Shell and Tesco.\n\nThe vote against BP's executive pay package is a significant blow to the company's reputation and its ability to attract investors. It also raises questions about the company's governance and its ability to manage its finances effectively.\n\nIn response to the vote, BP's chairman, Carl-Henric Svanberg, promised to review the company's executive pay package and to consider changes to the company's governance structure. However, it remains to be seen whether the company will take any concrete action to address the concerns of its shareholders.\n\nThe vote against BP's executive pay package is also a reflection of the growing concern among investors about the impact of low oil prices on the company's finances. The company's reliance on oil prices has made it vulnerable to fluctuations in the market, and the low oil prices have put pressure on the company's finances.\n\nOverall, the vote against BP's executive pay package is a significant development in the company's history, and it highlights the growing power of shareholders in shaping the company's strategy and governance.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The report does not draw conclusions on who is responsible for the attack, citing an ongoing U.S. government investigation.\n\nThe report states that the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to extract credit and debit card data from the systems, and the report notes that this type of hacking is becoming increasingly common due to its low risk and high reward.\n\nA separate report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach may be part of a broader international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report was sent to financial-services companies and retailers, but its contents have not been made public.\n\nBoth Neiman Marcus and Target have faced criticism for not informing customers sooner about the data breaches. Neiman Marcus has offered to provide customers with one year of free credit monitoring, while Target has offered two years of free credit monitoring to affected customers.

The discovery was made by a team of researchers at Caltech, led by Dr. Mike Brown, who is known for his role in reclassifying Pluto as a dwarf planet in 2006.\n\nThe new planet is thought to be a massive world that is responsible for the unusual orbits of several small, icy bodies in the outer reaches of the solar system. It is estimated to be about 5,000 times more massive than Pluto and has a highly eccentric orbit that takes it from 200 to 1,000 AU from the Sun.\n\nThe discovery of Planet 9 has sparked a new debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that it should be classified as a planet and others arguing that it should be classified as a dwarf planet.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal.

This condition can lead to heart attacks and strokes. A new study has found that people with coronary artery disease who experience large fluctuations in weight, known as yo-yo dieting, are at a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest weight fluctuations had a 78% higher risk of heart attack, a 117% higher risk of stroke, and a 124% higher risk of death compared to those who experienced little to no weight change. The study also found that yo-yo dieting was associated with a higher risk of new-onset diabetes.\n\nThe researchers believe that the findings of the study suggest that people with coronary artery disease should focus on maintaining a stable weight rather than trying to lose weight quickly. Dr. Sripal Bangalore, the lead author of the study, said, \"It's not just about losing weight, it's about keeping it off.\" He also noted that the study's findings should be a motivation for people to keep their weight off, rather than feeling like they can take a break from dieting.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research that has associated yo-yo dieting with poor heart health.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

The findings suggest that the incidence of colorectal cancer among younger individuals is rising, with an estimated one in four cases occurring in people under the age of 50 by 2030.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, noted that the traditional view of colorectal cancer as a disease of older adults is no longer accurate. \"Colorectal cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of older adults, but our study shows that it's increasingly affecting younger people,\" she said. \"This is a wake-up call for the medical community to take a closer look at the risk factors and screening guidelines for this disease.\"\n\nThe study found that younger patients with colorectal cancer are more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage, which can make treatment more challenging. However, the researchers also found that younger patients tend to have better survival rates than older patients, possibly due to more aggressive treatment and better overall health.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for public health policy and medical practice. The American Cancer Society recommends that adults begin regular screening for colorectal cancer at age 50, but the study's authors suggest that this age may need to be revised downward. \"We need to take a closer look at the risk factors and screening guidelines for this disease, and consider whether we need to start screening younger people,\" said Dr. Hendren.\n\nOther experts agree that the study's findings are significant, but also caution that the data is not yet clear enough to support a change in screening guidelines. \"While the study's findings are concerning, we need to be cautious about making changes to screening guidelines based on a single study,\" said Dr. Andrew Chan, a gastroenterologist at Harvard Medical School. \"We need to see more data and consider the potential consequences of changing the screening age before making any decisions.\"\n\nIn the meantime, experts recommend that individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors begin screening earlier, even if they are under the age of 50. \"If you have a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor about starting screening earlier,\" said Dr. Hendren", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The team, led by Dr. Giles Hamm, used a combination of radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) to determine the age of the artifacts.\n\nThe discovery suggests that humans were able to adapt to the harsh conditions of the Australian outback much earlier than previously thought. The team found evidence of human habitation in the region, including stone tools, ochre, and other artifacts, which were dated to between 49,000 and 45,000 years ago. This is significant because it pushes back the known timeline of human habitation in the region by thousands of years.\n\nThe discovery also provides new insights into the lives of early Australians. The team found evidence of a sophisticated tool-making tradition, with stone tools that were made using a technique known as \"pressure flaking.\" This technique involves using a stone tool to flake off small pieces of stone to create a sharp edge.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

This means that even if a civilization is able to harvest energy from the stars, it will eventually become impossible to communicate with other civilizations due to the vast distances between them.\n\nHooper proposes that advanced civilizations may be able to harvest energy from the stars by creating a network of satellites, known as a Dyson sphere, which would collect energy from the star and beam it back to the civilization. However, this would require a massive amount of energy and resources, and it is unclear whether it is feasible for human civilization to achieve this level of technological advancement.\n\nThe concept of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, including in the works of Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven. However, it is a real possibility that advanced civilizations may be able to harness energy from the stars in this way.\n\nIn addition to the concept of Dyson spheres, scientists are also exploring other ways to search for advanced alien civilizations. One way to do this is to look for signs of waste heat from advanced civilizations, which could be detectable from a distance. This is known as the \"waste heat\" hypothesis.\n\nOverall, the search for advanced alien civilizations is an active area of research, and scientists are exploring a variety of ways to search for signs of life beyond Earth. While the challenges are significant, the potential rewards are great, and scientists are optimistic that we may one day discover evidence of advanced alien civilizations.\n\nThe Internet Archive has also been collecting and preserving web pages and other digital content, including a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are contributed to the Internet Archive but may not be ingested into the Wayback Machine. This collection is known as WARCZone.\n\nIn conclusion, the search for advanced alien civilizations is an exciting and rapidly evolving field of research, with scientists exploring a variety of ways to search for signs of life beyond Earth.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it?

But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The surgery, which took six hours to complete, was a major success, and Kieran is now able to see his new ears for the first time.

The surgery is not only a cosmetic procedure but also has huge psychological benefits, as it can boost a child's confidence and self-esteem. Kieran's parents, David and Louise, are overjoyed with the result and are relieved that their son can now feel more accepted by his peers. The surgery is a major breakthrough in the field of reconstructive surgery, and it is hoped that it will become a standard procedure for children born with microtia. Researchers are also working on a new technique that uses stem cells to grow new ears, which could be less invasive and more effective than the current method.

{"pred": " \n\nJamaica has made a significant step towards decriminalizing marijuana, with lawmakers passing legislation that reduces possession of small quantities to a petty offense. The new law, which was approved by both houses of parliament, makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a non-arrestable offense, punishable by a fine. The legislation also paves the way for the development of a medical marijuana industry, with the establishment of a licensing authority to regulate the cultivation, distribution, and sale of cannabis for medicinal purposes.\n\nThe move is seen as a major victory for advocates of marijuana reform, who have been pushing for changes to the island's laws for decades. The new law is also expected to have a positive impact on the country's economy, with the potential for a new industry to create jobs and generate revenue.\n\nThe legislation has been welcomed by the international community, with the US assistant secretary for counter-narcotics, William Brown, saying that the decision was Jamaica's own to make. However, he noted that the US would continue to enforce its own laws regarding marijuana, which remains a controlled substance under US law.\n\nThe new law is also significant for the Rastafarian community, who have long used marijuana as a sacrament. The legislation allows for the use of marijuana for religious purposes, and is seen as a major victory for the community.\n\nThe move by Jamaica to decriminalize marijuana is part of a broader trend of countries relaxing their laws on the substance. In the US, several states have legalized marijuana for recreational use, and more than 20 states have laws allowing for the use of medical marijuana. In Canada, the government has announced plans to legalize marijuana for recreational use.\n\nThe Jamaican government has said that it hopes to establish a licensing authority to regulate the medical marijuana industry, and to create a framework for the cultivation, distribution, and sale of cannabis for medicinal purposes. The government has also said that it will work with international partners to ensure that the new industry is compliant with international laws and regulations.\n\nOverall, the decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is a significant step forward for the country, and is expected to have a positive impact on the economy and society.

This move has been widely criticized as a threat to civil liberties and the rule of law.\n\nIn a related development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, who are being held at Stony Brook University.

{"pred": " \nScientists have made significant discoveries about the history of Mars, revealing that the planet was once a warm and wet world with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its surface. According to NASA scientists, the ocean was at least a mile deep and lasted for millions of years, providing a habitable environment for life to emerge. The discovery was made by analyzing the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere and calculating how much water the planet has lost over time.\n\nThe research suggests that Mars had a global ocean that covered about 20% of its surface, which is roughly the size of the Arctic Ocean on Earth. The ocean was likely formed when Mars was still in its early stages of formation, around 4.5 billion years ago. The water was likely lost due to the planet's thin atmosphere, which allowed it to escape into space.\n\nThe findings are based on data collected by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter. The researchers used a technique called \"isotopic analysis\" to determine the ratio of hydrogen to deuterium in the Martian water vapor, which provided clues about the planet's past water history.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The presence of a large ocean in the past suggests that the planet may have had the necessary conditions for life to emerge and thrive. The researchers believe that the ocean may have been home to microorganisms, which could have played a crucial role in the planet's early ecosystem.\n\nThe study also provides new insights into the evolution of Mars and the Earth. The two planets are thought to have formed from the same disk of material around the Sun, and their early histories may have been similar. However, Mars lost its ocean and became a barren, cold world, while the Earth retained its water and developed a stable climate.\n\nThe discovery of a massive ocean on Mars has sparked renewed interest in the search for life on the Red Planet. NASA's Curiosity rover has been exploring Mars since 2012, and the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover is scheduled to launch in 2020. The rovers will search for signs of life on Mars, including biosignatures in the rocks and soil.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of a massive ocean on Mars provides new insights into the planet's history and the search for life on the Red Planet. The findings suggest that Mars was once a warm and wet world, with a habitable environment that may have supported life.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T-Rex and other large dinosaurs may have made low-frequency, closed-mouth sounds, similar to those made by birds today. The researchers used statistical analysis to examine the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and found that it has evolved independently at least 16 times in different bird lineages. This suggests that the ability to make closed-mouth sounds may have been present in the ancestors of modern birds and dinosaurs, and may have been used for mating displays.\n\nThe study's lead author, Chad Eliason, said that the findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and evolution. \"This study shows that dinosaurs may have been more complex and nuanced in their behavior than we previously thought,\" he said. \"It's not just about roaring and fighting, but also about communication and mating.\"\n\nThe researchers used a combination of fossil evidence, comparative anatomy, and statistical analysis to reach their conclusions. They found that the ability to make closed-mouth sounds is associated with large body size in birds, and that it is more common in species that are known to engage in complex mating displays.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research on the evolution of bird vocalization, which has shown that birds have a unique vocal organ called the syrinx that allows them to produce a wide range of sounds. The researchers suggest that the syrinx may have evolved in the ancestors of modern birds and dinosaurs, and that it may have been used for both open- and closed-mouth vocalization.\n\nThe study's authors also note that the findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalization. \"This study shows that the evolution of bird vocalization is more complex and nuanced than we previously thought,\" said co-author Julia Clarke. \"It's not just about the development of the syrinx, but also about the evolution of behavior and ecology.\"\n\nThe researchers plan to continue their study of bird vocalization and its evolution, and to explore the implications of their findings for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and evolution.\n\nIn a related study, researchers used a combination of fossil evidence and comparative anatomy to examine the evolution of bird vocalization.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they were able to reconstruct YouTube videos from the brain activity of their subjects. This achievement is a significant step towards understanding how the brain processes visual information and could potentially lead to the development of technology that can read our minds.\n\nThe researchers used a computer model to match brain activity with features of the videos, allowing them to reconstruct the videos from the brain activity of their subjects. The reconstructed videos are blurry and dream-like, but they are a continuous representation of the actual videos. This is a major leap forward in the field of neuroscience, as it shows that it is possible to decode dynamic visual experiences from brain activity.\n\nThe researchers believe that this technology could one day be used to broadcast imagery from the brain, allowing people to see what others are seeing. This could have a wide range of applications, from allowing people who are paralyzed to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements, to potentially even reading people's dreams and memories.\n\nHowever, the researchers also acknowledge that there are limitations to the technology. For example, it is not yet possible to decode complex visual information, such as the content of a video, and it is also not possible to distinguish between different types of visual experiences, such as dreams and memories.\n\nDespite these limitations, the researchers are optimistic about the potential of this technology.

Recently, there have been discussions about using statistical tools, specifically Bayesian statistics, to help locate the plane. Bayesian statistics is a method of statistical inference that uses probability to update the probability of a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. \n\nIn the case of the disappearance of Flight 370, Bayesian statistics can be used to update the probability of different locations where the plane may have crashed. The method involves using historical data and expert opinions to create a probability map of the possible locations of the plane. \n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in the search for Flight 370 has been successful in the past. In 2011, a team of statisticians used Bayesian statistics to help locate the wreckage of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. The team was able to narrow down the search area to a small region, and the wreckage was eventually found. \n\nHowever, the search for Flight 370 has been more challenging. The plane disappeared on March 8, 2014, and despite extensive searches, no wreckage has been found. The use of Bayesian statistics has been proposed as a way to help locate the plane, but it is not clear whether it will be successful. \n\nOne of the challenges in using Bayesian statistics in the search for Flight 370 is the lack of data. There is limited information available about the plane's flight path and the circumstances of its disappearance. Additionally, the search area is vast, and the probability of finding the plane is low. \n\nDespite these challenges, some experts believe that Bayesian statistics can still be useful in the search for Flight 370. Colleen Keller, a statistician who worked on the search for Air France Flight 447, believes that Bayesian statistics can help narrow down the search area and increase the chances of finding the plane. \n\nHowever, others are more skeptical. Tony O'Driscoll, a statistician who has worked on the search for Flight 370, believes that Bayesian statistics is not the right tool for the job. He argues that the search area is too large, and the probability of finding the plane is too low. \n\nThe search for Flight 370 continues, and the use of Bayesian statistics is just one of the many tools being used to try to locate the plane.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

However, the prosecution has argued that it is seeking the harshest possible punishment for the former president and his family.\n\nThe elections and the trial are seen as critical moments in Egypt's transition to democracy. The country is still reeling from the effects of the uprising against Mubarak's regime, and many Egyptians are eager to see a new government take power. The Muslim Brotherhood's expected gains in the elections are seen as a significant development, and could have major implications for the country's future.\n\nThe elections and the trial are also being closely watched by the international community. The United States and other Western countries have been critical of Mubarak's regime and have been supportive of the Egyptian people's demand for democracy. The outcome of the elections and the trial will be closely watched by the international community, and could have major implications for Egypt's relations with the West.\n\nIn", "answers": ["The final round of voting began in Egypt today, and it looks like the Muslim Brotherhood could walk off with a controlling majority of seats in Parliament's lower house. The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
