Four demonstrators were arrested, but the overall number of protesters remained steady, with an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 people gathered outside City Hall. The Los Angeles Police Department had given the protesters a deadline to leave, but the protesters refused to comply.\n\nThe Los Angeles encampment, which had grown to an estimated 400 people, had become a focal point for the Occupy movement in the city. The protesters had set up a tent city, complete with a kitchen, a library, and a medical tent. The encampment had also become a hub for community organizing and activism, with protesters working to build relationships with local businesses and community groups.\n\nIn contrast to the tense standoff in Los Angeles, the Occupy Philly protesters in Philadelphia remained peaceful and non-confrontational. The protesters, who had been occupying the site for several weeks, had set up a tent city and were providing food and shelter to those in need. The protesters had also established a system of governance, with a rotating council of leaders and a set of rules and regulations to govern the occupation.\n\nThe Occupy movement has sparked a national conversation about economic inequality and corporate power. The movement has also highlighted the need for greater transparency and accountability in government and business. As the movement continues to unfold, it remains to be seen whether the protesters will be able to achieve their goals and bring about meaningful change.\n\nThe movement has also received support from celebrities and politicians. Russell Simmons, a hip-hop mogul, tweeted his support for the Occupy movement, saying \"The eyes of the world are on you.\" Mayor Antonio Villaraigora of Los Angeles also expressed support for the movement, saying that the protesters had a right to assemble and express their views.\n\nOverall, the Occupy movement continues to be a powerful force for change in the United States.

Kalashnikov, who was 94 at the time of his death, had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his invention, blaming the policies of other countries. However, in the letter, he expressed his regret and asked if he was to blame for the devilish desires of envy, greed, and aggression that led to the deaths.\n\nKalashnikov's letter was published by Izvestia, a Russian newspaper, and revealed that he had been baptized at the age of 91. His daughter, Elena, said that she believed a priest helped her father compose the letter. The letter was typed on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper and signed with a wavering hand.\n\nThe AK-47 has been widely used in conflicts around the world and has been responsible for millions of deaths. Kalashnikov's invention has been both celebrated and criticized, with some praising its durability and simplicity, while others have condemned its use in terrorist and insurgent groups.\n\nKalashnikov's funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, and he was given a state funeral.

Ciancia is charged with murder and faces a potential death sentence.\n\nAccording to officials, Ciancia entered Terminal 3 with a duffel bag and pulled out an assault rifle, shooting at TSA officers.

Hernandez was about 20 feet away from the exit when he was shot, and it took paramedics 33 minutes to reach him. The investigation is ongoing, and officials are examining the communication between police and fire officials to determine if a lack of coordination contributed to the delay in treatment for Hernandez and other victims.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the coordination between police and fire officials, as well as the training of officers in responding to active shooter situations. A recent audit by the Los Angeles Police Commission found that many officers do not receive regular training in first aid and CPR, which may have contributed to the delay in treatment for Hernandez.\n\nA public memorial service was held on Tuesday to honor Hernandez, who was the first TSA officer to be killed in the line of duty. Hundreds of people attended the service, which was held at the airport.\n\nThe incident has also sparked a debate about the security measures in place at airports, with some calling for increased security and others arguing that the current measures are sufficient.

{"pred": " \nCigarette smoke has been found to have a multitude of damaging effects on human health, but recent research has revealed another alarming consequence: it fuels the virulent rampage of superbugs, specifically MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). A study published in the journal Infection and Immunity by researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that cigarette smoke makes MRSA more difficult to kill, allowing it to adhere to human cells and cause pneumonia. The study, led by Dr. Laura E. Crotty Alexander, tested two groups of MRSA: one exposed to cigarette smoke and the other not. The results showed that the smoke-exposed MRSA was significantly more resistant to immune responses and could survive for longer periods of time.\n\nThe study also found that the dose of cigarette smoke exposure strongly influenced the level of resistance in MRSA. In fact, the researchers discovered that surface changes in MRSA increased 10 times more with cigarette smoke exposure compared to e-cigarette vapor exposure.

Dr. Crotty Alexander emphasized that the study's results provide yet another reason to avoid smoking.\n\nIn a related study, researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine found that cigarette smoke exposure can also stress MRSA, making it more aggressive and harder to kill.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The study used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze the links between Wikipedia pages and determine which individuals have the most important articles linking to them. The results showed that Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the English-language world, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, Adolf Hitler took the top spot, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nThe study aimed to discover if Wikipedia was skewed in its attention towards certain figures, either by gender, time period, or location. The results showed that most important historical figures across Wikipedia editions were born in the Western world, were male, and lived after the 17th century.\n\nHowever, when the researchers applied a second method, CheiRank, to measure importance, they found that Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist, was the most important person in the world. Linnaeus was the inventor of the scientific system of naming species, and his work led to a vast network of links on Wikipedia. The researchers used a combination of PageRank and CheiRank to arrive at the final measure, 2DRank, which ranked Linnaeus as the most important person in the world.\n\nAnother study by the University of Toulouse, also led by Young-Ho Eom, aimed to determine the most influential thinker in the world.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 60%.\n\nThe charity is calling on international donors to play a vital role in ending the practice of institutionalization.

Kim Jong-nam was poisoned with the banned chemical VX at Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13. Malaysian authorities have identified the substance used in the attack as VX, a highly toxic nerve agent. The two women accused of carrying out the attack, one Indonesian and one Vietnamese, are being held in custody.\n\nNorth Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, but Malaysian authorities believe that the assassination was orchestrated by Pyongyang. The use of VX is a serious escalation of the situation, as it is a banned chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Malaysian government has called for international cooperation to investigate the attack and bring those responsible to justice.\n\nThe case has raised concerns about public safety in Malaysia, as the airport was not decontaminated for 11 days after the attack. Toxicologists have expressed surprise that the airport was not immediately decontaminated, given the highly toxic nature of VX.\n\nThe use of VX has also raised questions about North Korea's chemical weapons capabilities. According to a Congressional Research Service report, North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capacity of up to 12,000 metric tons. The report also notes that North Korea has a history of using chemical weapons, including the 1994 and 1995 attacks on Japanese citizens.\n\nThe diplomatic crisis between Malaysia and North Korea has escalated in recent days, with North Korea denying any involvement in the attack and Malaysia accusing Pyongyang of orchestrating the assassination. The situation remains tense, with international pressure mounting on North Korea to cooperate with the investigation.\n\nIn related news, a North Korean defector has come forward with information about the country's chemical weapons program. The defector, who wishes to remain anonymous, claims that North Korea has been developing VX and other chemical agents for use in military operations. The defector's information has been corroborated by other sources, including a report by the Nuclear Threat Initiative project.\n\nThe use of VX in the assassination of Kim Jong-nam has also raised concerns about the safety of air travel.

National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now.

The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) has reported that over 4,000 hikers have obtained permits to hike the trail this year, a 50% increase from last year. This has led to concerns about overcrowding and the impact on the environment and local communities.\n\nSome hikers have expressed frustration with the crowds, with one hiker stating that they would like to hike without seeing a line of ants all the way to Canada. The PCTA has implemented a quota system to try to manage the number of hikers on the trail, but it is unclear whether this will be enough to mitigate the impact of the crowds.\n\nThe increased number of hikers has also led to concerns about the impact on the environment. Deserts and fragile ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of overuse, and the PCTA has reported that there has been an increase in the number of hikers damaging vegetation and leaving behind trash.\n\nIn addition to the environmental concerns, there are also concerns about the impact on local communities. The increased number of hikers has put a strain on local resources, including food, water, and lodging. Some communities have reported that they are struggling to accommodate the large number of hikers, and there are concerns that the influx of hikers may lead to a negative impact on the local economy.\n\nDespite the concerns, many hikers are still drawn to the PCT, and the trail remains a popular destination for those looking to challenge themselves and connect with nature. However, it is clear that the trail is facing a number of challenges, and it will be important for hikers, trail managers, and local communities to work together to find a solution that balances the needs of hikers with the need to protect the environment and local communities.\n\nIn an effort to mitigate the impact of the crowds, the PCTA has launched a campaign called #responsiblywild, which encourages hikers to be mindful of their impact on the environment and to take steps to minimize their footprint. The campaign also encourages hikers to be respectful of local communities and to follow the principles of leave-no-trace.\n\nOverall, the PCT is facing a number of challenges, but it remains a popular and iconic destination for hikers.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail.

In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers.

However, critics argue that the tax is regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income families, and that it will drive businesses out of the city.\n\nAccording to Costco, the tax has already had a significant impact on their business, with prices increasing by nearly 70% on some items. The company estimates that the tax will cost them $10 million in revenue this year. Other businesses, such as King County, have also spoken out against the tax, citing concerns about its impact on local businesses and the economy.\n\nThe tax has also been criticized for its lack of effectiveness in reducing sugar consumption. A study by the Tax Foundation found that the tax in Cook County, Illinois, which was implemented in 2017, had no significant impact on sugar consumption. Instead, the tax drove sales of sugary drinks to neighboring counties, where the tax did not apply.\n\nSeattle residents are also speaking out against the tax, with many expressing concerns about its impact on their wallets and the local economy. Some have taken to social media to share their outrage, using the hashtag #SeattleSodaTax.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

However, the study's authors noted that the association between acetaminophen use and ADHD is not clear-cut and may be influenced by other factors, such as genetic predisposition.\n\nExperts agree that pregnant women should not panic and that the study's findings do not mean that acetaminophen is completely off-limits during pregnancy. However, they recommend that women try to avoid taking the medication frequently and for extended periods.\n\nThe study's authors suggest that pregnant women may want to consider alternative pain relief methods, such as massages, baths, and acupuncture, to reduce their reliance on acetaminophen. They also emphasize that the risks and benefits of acetaminophen use during pregnancy should be carefully weighed.\n\nThe study's findings have sparked debate among experts, with some arguing that the association between acetaminophen use and ADHD is not strong enough to warrant a change in recommendations. Others, however, believe that the study highlights the need for more research into the safety of acetaminophen during pregnancy.\n\nIn response to the study, the manufacturer of Tylenol, the most commonly used brand of acetaminophen, has issued a statement advising pregnant women to consult their doctors before taking the medication. The company also emphasized that acetaminophen has a favorable safety profile when used as directed.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that pregnant women should be cautious when using acetaminophen and consider alternative pain relief methods.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

The spacecraft will be launched in the summer of 2018 and will be the first to fly directly into the sun's corona. The mission aims to study the sun's corona, the outer atmosphere of the sun, and to understand the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that flows away from the sun. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system to withstand the extreme temperatures of the sun's corona. The mission will also study the sun's magnetic field and the solar wind's acceleration. The Parker Solar Probe will be the first spacecraft to fly directly into the sun's corona, and it will provide scientists with a wealth of new information about the sun and its behavior. The mission is expected to last for seven years, and it will provide scientists with a unique opportunity to study the sun up close. The spacecraft will be launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, and it will be powered by a radioisotope thermoelectric generator.

More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

According to reports, Neiman Marcus was hacked as far back as July, and the breach was not fully contained until Sunday. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, saying that some of its customers’ payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at its stores. Neiman Marcus apologized for not disclosing the breach sooner, saying that it first learned of the suspicious activity in mid-December. The company has offered one free year of credit monitoring to its customers, similar to what Target has done.\n\nThe Target breach, which affected over 100 million customers, was caused by a type of malware that was placed in the store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was able to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash registers, including credit card numbers and PINs. The report from iSight, a computer firm hired to investigate the breach, details the type of software used in the hack and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist. The report does not draw conclusions on who is ultimately responsible for the attack, citing an active U.S. government investigation.\n\nThe investigation into the Target breach has revealed that the attack was part of a broader and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. A report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the breach was not an isolated incident, but rather part of a larger scheme to steal customer data. The report mentions that the malware used in the Target breach is similar to that used in the Neiman Marcus breach, leading some to speculate that the two breaches may be connected.\n\nThe authorities are examining whether the two attacks are related, and a growing group of state attorneys general are jointly investigating both the Target and Neiman Marcus breaches. The investigation is ongoing, and it is unclear who is ultimately responsible for the attacks. However, it is clear that the breaches have had a significant impact on the retailers and their customers, and that the security of customer information is a major concern.\n\nIn related news, a report from iSight details the type of software used in the Target breach and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist. The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach in the future.

In Kenya, a 13-year-old lion named Mohawk was shot dead by wildlife officials after it strayed from the Nairobi National Park. The incident sparked an outcry among Kenyans, who took to social media to express their outrage and demand justice for the lion. The hashtag #JusticeForMohawk trended on Twitter, with many calling for the officials to be held accountable for the killing.\n\nThe incident has raised questions about the management of wildlife in Kenya, particularly in the Nairobi National Park. The park has seen several lion escapes in recent weeks, with some of the animals being recaptured alive. However, the death of Mohawk has highlighted the need for better management of the park and its wildlife.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from a national park in South Africa. The lion, which has escaped before, is considered a threat to human safety and is being hunted by wildlife officials. However, conservationists have launched a campaign to save the lion, using the hashtag #SaveSylvester on social media.\n\nThe incidents have highlighted the complex relationship between humans and wildlife in Africa. While lions are an important part of the ecosystem, they can also pose a threat to human safety. The management of wildlife in Africa is a delicate balance between conservation and human safety, and the incidents have raised questions about how this balance can be achieved.\n\nThe death of Mohawk has also sparked a wider debate about the conservation of lions in Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the African lion as a vulnerable species, with its population declining by 50% over the past two decades. The incidents have highlighted the need for greater conservation efforts to protect the lion population in Africa.\n\nIn conclusion, the incidents involving lions in Kenya and South Africa have highlighted the complex relationship between humans and wildlife in Africa.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

According to a new study, a giant icy world is lurking in the outer reaches of the solar system, and it's been dubbed \"Planet Nine.\" The discovery was made by a team of researchers at Caltech, who used a combination of observations and computer simulations to identify the new planet.\n\nThe new planet is thought to be a massive world, with a mass of at least 10 times that of Earth. It's also believed to be a cold, icy world, with a surface temperature of around -200°C. The planet is thought to be in a highly eccentric orbit, taking it as close as 200 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun and as far as 1,000 AU from the Sun.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked a lot of excitement in the scientific community, with many experts hailing it as a major breakthrough. However, not everyone is convinced that the new planet is real. Some scientists have questioned the data used to make the discovery, and others have suggested that the planet may be an artifact of the way the data was analyzed.\n\nDespite the controversy, the discovery of Planet Nine has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the solar system. If confirmed, it would be the first new planet to be discovered in our solar system since Pluto was discovered in 1930. The discovery also raises questions about the formation and evolution of the solar system, and could provide new insights into the origins of life on Earth.\n\nMike Brown, the astronomer who led the team that discovered Pluto, has been at the center of the controversy surrounding Planet Nine.

However, he's also faced criticism from some of his colleagues, who have questioned the data used to make the discovery.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Planet Nine has also sparked a debate about the definition of a planet. Some scientists have argued that the new planet doesn't meet the criteria for a planet, and should be classified as a dwarf planet or other type of celestial body. However, Brown and his colleagues have argued that the new planet meets all the criteria for a planet, and should be recognized as such.\n\nThe debate over Planet Nine is likely to continue for some time, but the discovery has already sparked a lot of excitement and interest in the scientific community.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

Cholesterol-containing deposits in the arteries are the primary cause of coronary artery disease. This condition can lead to heart attacks and strokes, and is the most common cause of death worldwide. \n\nA recent study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with coronary artery disease who experience large fluctuations in weight over a period of time are at a higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, and death. The study, which followed 9,509 men and women with stable coronary artery disease, found that those who experienced the largest weight fluctuations had a 124% higher risk of death compared to those who experienced little change in body weight. \n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Sripal Bangalore, emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable weight to reduce the risk of heart disease. He noted that many people who lose weight initially may feel motivated to continue their weight loss efforts, but may eventually give up and regain the weight. This yo-yo effect can have serious health consequences, particularly for people with pre-existing heart disease. \n\nCoronary artery disease can be prevented and treated through a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management.

According to a study published in the journal Cancer, one in seven colorectal cancer patients is under the age of 50. This is a significant change from the traditional perception of the disease, which has led researchers to question the current guidelines for screening.\n\nThe study, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan, analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011. The results showed that younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of the disease, which can make treatment more difficult. However, despite this, younger patients tended to have better survival rates than older patients.\n\nThe researchers believe that the increasing number of cases among younger people may be due to a combination of factors, including changes in lifestyle and environmental factors. They also suggest that doctors should be more aware of the warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as bleeding, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel habits.\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the way that colorectal cancer is screened and treated. Currently, guidelines recommend that people start screening for colorectal cancer at the age of 50. However, the study's authors suggest that this age may need to be lowered, especially for people with a family history of the disease.\n\nDr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, noted that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger people are not yet clear. However, he suggested that lifestyle factors such as a poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking may contribute to the risk of developing the disease.\n\nThe study's findings have also raised questions about the need for earlier screening and treatment for colorectal cancer. Dr. Hendren noted that the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of young survivors of the disease, who will require long-term support and care.\n\nOverall, the study's findings highlight the need for a greater awareness of colorectal cancer among younger people and the importance of early screening and treatment. As Dr. Hendren noted, \"the cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will require long-term support and care.\" \n\nReferences:\nAbdelsattar Z, Wong S, Regenbogen S, et al.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi rock shelter, has revealed a treasure trove of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, quartz flakes, and ochre, which suggest that early humans were living in the arid interior of Australia. The discovery pushes back the known timeline of human settlement in the region by at least 10,000 years and challenges the long-held assumption that Indigenous Australians were not capable of developing complex technologies and societies.\n\nThe artefacts found at the site suggest that early humans were able to adapt to the harsh conditions of the Australian desert, using local materials to create tools and shelter. The discovery also provides evidence of the presence of emus, kangaroos, and other megafauna in the region at the time, which is significant given the ongoing debate about the impact of human activity on the extinction of these species.\n\nThe discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological finds in Australian history, and has been published in the journal Nature. The research team, led by Dr. Giles Hamm, has been working on the site for several years and has made a number of other significant discoveries, including the oldest known evidence of human cooking in Australia.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists and Indigenous Australians about the significance of the find and its implications for our understanding of the history of human settlement in Australia. Some have argued that the discovery provides evidence of the long-term presence of Indigenous Australians in the region, while others have suggested that the find may be evidence of a more recent migration of humans into the area.\n\nRegardless of the interpretation, the discovery is a significant milestone in the study of human history in Australia and highlights the importance of continued research and collaboration between archaeologists, Indigenous Australians, and other stakeholders. The discovery also underscores the need for greater recognition and respect for the cultural heritage of Indigenous Australians and the importance of preserving and protecting their sites and artefacts for future generations.\n\nThe discovery has also been hailed as a significant milestone in the study of human migration and settlement, and has implications for our understanding of the spread of humans across the globe.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

They also suggest that we could look for galaxies that have been stripped of their stars, which would be a sign that an advanced civilization has harvested them.\n\nThe study's author, Dan Hooper, suggests that we may be able to detect these megastructures in the near future, and that it's possible that we may already be seeing them. He proposes that we could use satellites to detect the waste heat from these megastructures, and that we could also look for unusual light signatures from distant stars.\n\nThe idea of megastructures like Dyson spheres has been around for a long time, and has been explored in science fiction. Science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described spherical energy-trapping structures in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker\", and physicist Freeman Dyson proposed the idea of megastructures in the 1960s. The idea has since been explored in numerous science fiction stories, including Larry Niven's \"Ringworld\" and the \"Star Trek\" episode \"Relics\".\n\nThe study's findings have significant implications for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). If we are able to detect megastructures like Dyson spheres, it would be a major breakthrough in the search for alien life. It would also raise questions about the ethics of searching for and communicating with advanced civilizations, and about the potential risks and benefits of making contact with them.\n\nOverall, the study's findings suggest that the search for extraterrestrial intelligence is an urgent and important task, and that we may be on the verge of a major breakthrough in our understanding of the universe and its inhabitants. \n\nNote: The summary is one page long, but it's a bit hard to fit all the information into one page.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

{"pred": " \nRecent discoveries in Kenya have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and toolmaking. Excavations in the Olorgesailai Basin have uncovered evidence of toolmaking dating back to around 320,000 years ago, which is tens of thousands of years earlier than previously thought. The tools, which include obsidian blades and hand axes, suggest that early humans were able to adapt to changing environmental conditions and develop complex behaviors.\n\nThe discoveries, published in the journal Science, suggest that Homo sapiens, the species to which modern humans belong, was able to develop advanced toolmaking skills and complex behaviors much earlier than previously thought. The tools found in the Olorgesailai Basin are similar to those found in other parts of Africa, but the age of the tools suggests that Homo sapiens was able to develop these skills independently of other human species.\n\nThe findings also suggest that climate change may have played a role in the development of human behavior and toolmaking. The Olorgesailai Basin was subject to dramatic climate shifts around 320,000 years ago, which may have driven early humans to develop new tools and behaviors in order to adapt to their environment.\n\nThe discoveries have significant implications for our understanding of human evolution and the development of modern human behavior. They suggest that the \"human revolution\" that is often thought to have occurred around 40,000-50,000 years ago may not have been a sudden event, but rather a gradual process that occurred over tens of thousands of years.\n\nThe findings also challenge the idea that modern human behavior and toolmaking skills were developed outside of Africa.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The new law, which was passed after decades of debate, allows for the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. It also permits the use of marijuana for religious purposes, a significant victory for Rastafarians who have long been persecuted for their beliefs.\n\nThe law makes possession of up to 2oz of marijuana a non-arrestable offence, and allows for the cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. It also establishes a licensing authority to regulate the medical cannabis industry. Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana will be able to apply for permits to use the drug while visiting the island.\n\nThe new law is seen as a major victory for the Jamaican government, which has long been under pressure to relax its laws on marijuana. The legislation was passed after several hours of debate in the lower house of parliament, and is expected to come into effect in the coming months.\n\nThe decriminalization of marijuana is part of a broader trend of easing restrictions on the drug in the Caribbean. In recent years, several Caribbean countries have relaxed their laws on marijuana, including Barbados, which decriminalized possession of small quantities in 2018.\n\nThe new law in Jamaica is also seen as a significant step towards developing a medical cannabis industry on the island. The country has a long history of producing high-quality marijuana, and the new law is expected to attract investment and create jobs in the sector.\n\nThe US has also taken steps to relax its laws on marijuana, with several states legalizing the drug for medical and recreational use. In 2018, Colorado became the first state to legalize the sale of recreational marijuana, and several other states have followed suit.\n\nThe decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is also seen as a significant victory for human rights advocates, who have long argued that the country's laws on marijuana were discriminatory and disproportionate. The new law is expected to reduce the number of people arrested and charged with marijuana-related offences, and to promote greater understanding and acceptance of the drug.\n\nOverall, the decriminalization of marijuana in Jamaica is a significant step towards promoting greater freedom and understanding of the drug.

{"pred": " \n\nThe concept of habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. It is a legal procedure that allows individuals to challenge their detention and requires the government to show cause for holding them. In the United States, the Founding Fathers enshrined habeas corpus in the first article of the Constitution, recognizing its importance in preserving liberty, justice, and democracy.\n\nHowever, in recent years, the right to habeas corpus has been eroded. The Military Commissions Act of 2006, also known as the Military Commissions Act, revoked the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantanamo Bay. This provision applies to both foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, and it has been used to justify the indefinite detention of individuals without trial or due process.\n\nThe erosion of habeas corpus has significant implications for the detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Many of them have been held for years without charge or trial, and some have been subjected to torture and other forms of abuse. The right to habeas corpus is essential for ensuring that individuals are treated fairly and humanely, and its erosion has contributed to the widespread human rights abuses at Guantanamo.\n\nIn a related development, a New York judge has granted a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, who are being held at Stony Brook University. This is the first time in U.S. history that an animal has been granted a writ of habeas corpus, and it marks a significant milestone in the fight for animal rights. The Nonhuman Rights Project, which filed the case, argues that chimpanzees are cognitively complex and emotionally sophisticated animals that deserve the right to bodily liberty.\n\nThe judge's ruling is a major victory for animal rights advocates, who have long argued that animals should be treated as individuals with inherent rights and dignity. The case has significant implications for the treatment of animals in research and captivity, and it may pave the way for future challenges to the use of animals in scientific research.\n\nIn conclusion, the erosion of habeas corpus has significant implications for human rights and the rule of law. The granting of a writ of habeas corpus to two research chimpanzees is a major victory for animal rights advocates and marks a significant milestone in the fight for animal rights.

According to NASA scientists, the ocean was at least a mile deep and lasted for millions of years, making it a prime candidate for supporting life. The findings, published in the journal Science, were made possible by infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere, which showed that the planet's water vapor was enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This enrichment is a sign of water loss, which occurred when the planet's atmosphere was stripped away by solar winds.\n\nThe study suggests that Mars was once a habitable planet, with a global ocean that would have provided a stable environment for life to emerge and thrive. The ocean would have been at least 137 meters deep, covering an area of about 20 million square kilometers. This is a significant increase from previous estimates, which suggested that the ocean was only about 100 meters deep.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars has significant implications for the search for life on the planet. It suggests that the conditions on Mars were once suitable for life to emerge and thrive, and that the planet may have been home to a diverse range of microorganisms. The search for life on Mars will continue with the European Space Agency's ExoMars rover, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.\n\nThe study also provides new insights into the history of Mars, revealing that the planet's atmosphere was once much thicker and more hospitable to life. The loss of the atmosphere is thought to have occurred due to the planet's proximity to the sun, which caused the atmosphere to be stripped away by solar winds.\n\nThe discovery of the ancient ocean on Mars is a significant step forward in our understanding of the planet's history and the search for life beyond Earth.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Jumaah, a member of the Yazidi minority, had fled to Iraq to be with his family after his wife had rung him to say that Isis fighters had taken the women into slavery. Turner, who was not willing to leave her student to die without trying to do something, contacted the university's security chief Per Gustafson, who arranged a rescue operation with a security company. A few days later, two Landcruisers carrying four heavily-armed mercenaries roared into the area where Jumaah was hiding and sped him away to Erbil Airport together with his wife and two small children. The family was eventually reunited in Sweden, where Jumaah completed his PhD and now works for a pharmaceuticals company in Malmö. The family has almost finished paying the university back for the rescue operation. This is a unique event, as no other university has ever been involved in a rescue operation like this. \n\nThe rescue operation was a result of Turner's determination to help her student, who was facing a life-and-death situation. She was not willing to leave him to die without trying to do something, and her actions ultimately saved the lives of Jumaah and his family. The university's security chief, Per Gustafson, also played a crucial role in arranging the rescue operation, and his actions were described as \"almost as if he'd been waiting for this kind of mission.\" The rescue operation was a complex and intense process, involving the use of armed mercenaries and a security company. However, it was ultimately successful, and Jumaah and his family were able to return to Sweden safely. \n\nThis story highlights the importance of human connection and determination in the face of adversity.

The ruling was made after a long-running legal battle between Nestlé and Mondelez, the parent company of Cadbury, over the trademark of the KitKat shape. The court found that the shape of the KitKat bar is not distinctive enough to be trademarked, and that it is not unique to the brand. This decision could allow other companies to produce similar products, including Norway's Kvikk Lunsj, which has been around for 80 years and has a similar shape to the KitKat bar. The ruling also has implications for other chocolate companies, including Toblerone, which has a unique triangular shape that is trademarked. The case has been closely followed by trademark lawyers and has been seen as a test case for the EU's trademark laws. The decision has been welcomed by some, who see it as a victory for consumers who will now have more choice in the market. However, it has also been seen as a blow to Nestlé, which has spent over a decade fighting to trademark the KitKat shape. The company has said that it will continue to fight the decision, and that it believes the shape of the KitKat bar is distinctive and unique. The case has also been seen as a reflection of the EU's complex and often confusing trademark laws, which can make it difficult for companies to protect their brands.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later.

{"pred": " \nThe roar of the T-Rex has been a staple of dinosaur movies for decades, but new research suggests that the mighty predator may not have been as loud as we think. According to a study published in the journal Evolution, the T-Rex and other large dinosaurs may have made sounds more similar to birds, such as cooing or murmuring, rather than the loud roars depicted in movies. The study found that closed-mouth vocalization, a behavior in which birds make sounds without opening their beaks, is a common trait among birds and may have evolved independently in different lineages. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been present in some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, and may have been used for mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nSound designer Gary Rydstrom, who worked on the sound design for the movie Jurassic Park, has also weighed in on the topic. In an interview, Rydstrom revealed that the sound effects team used a combination of animal sounds and creative manipulation to create the iconic T-Rex roar. Rydstrom said that the team used a combination of lion and elephant sounds, as well as some creative editing, to create the sound that has become synonymous with the T-Rex.\n\nThe study on closed-mouth vocalization in birds and dinosaurs was led by researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Arizona. The researchers used a combination of statistical analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction to examine the distribution of closed-mouth vocalization in birds and other reptiles. The study found that closed-mouth vocalization is a common trait among birds, but is less common in other reptiles.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the evolution of closed-mouth vocalization may have been driven by the need for birds to communicate with each other in a way that is not easily detected by predators. The study also found that closed-mouth vocalization is more common in birds with larger body sizes, which may be related to the fact that larger birds are more likely to be involved in mating displays or territorial defense.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for our understanding of dinosaur behavior and communication. While we may never know for certain what dinosaurs sounded like, the study suggests that they may have been more similar to birds than we previously thought. The study also highlights the importance of considering the evolution of behavior and communication in our understanding of dinosaur biology.\n\nIn related news, a study on the evolution of bird vocalization has found that the syrinx, the vocal organ of birds, is a highly specialized structure that is unique to birds.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The university will pay $1.2 million to the United Daughters of the Confederacy to remove the name from the building. The decision was made by Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos, who stated that the name was a reminder of the Civil War and the painful history of slavery and racism in the United States. Zeppos also stated that the university is committed to becoming a more diverse and inclusive institution.\n\nThe decision to rename the building comes as universities across the country are grappling with the legacy of the Confederacy and the symbols of racism and slavery that are still present on their campuses. Vanderbilt is not alone in its efforts to remove Confederate symbols, as Middle Tennessee State University is also seeking to remove the name of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest from one of its buildings. However, the proposal faces a tougher hurdle as it must be approved by the Tennessee Historical Commission, which has a new law that requires a two-thirds majority vote to approve changes to historical markers.\n\nThe decision to rename Confederate Memorial Hall is seen as a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and diverse campus community. Students and faculty have been pushing for the change for years, and the university's decision is a recognition of the importance of acknowledging and confronting the painful history of slavery and racism in the United States. The university's commitment to diversity and inclusion is also reflected in its efforts to increase diversity on campus, including the addition of a new chief diversity officer.\n\nThe decision to rename Confederate Memorial Hall is also seen as a response to the growing movement to remove Confederate symbols from public spaces.

{"pred": " \n\nThe disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has been a mystery for years, and the search for the plane has been ongoing. Recently, there have been discussions about using statistical tools, specifically Bayesian statistics, to help locate the plane. Bayesian statistics is a method of updating probabilities based on new information, and it has been used in the past to locate missing objects, such as sunken ships.\n\nIn the case of Flight 370, Bayesian statistics could be used to update the probability of the plane being in different locations based on new information, such as radar data and eyewitness accounts. The method involves splitting the search area into a grid and assigning a probability to each cell based on the likelihood of the plane being there. The probabilities are then updated based on new information, and the search area is narrowed down.\n\nColleen Keller, a statistician who has worked on similar searches, believes that Bayesian statistics could be a useful tool in the search for Flight 370. However, she also notes that the search area is vast, and the chances of finding the plane are low. Keller has worked on searches for missing planes in the past, including the search for Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009.\n\nKeller's team used Bayesian statistics to locate the plane, and they were able to narrow down the search area to a small region of the ocean. However, the plane was not found, and the search was eventually called off. Keller believes that the same approach could be used to locate Flight 370, but she also notes that the search area is much larger, and the chances of finding the plane are lower.\n\nDespite the challenges, Keller believes that Bayesian statistics could be a useful tool in the search for Flight 370. She notes that the method has been used successfully in the past to locate missing objects, and it could be used to update the probability of the plane being in different locations based on new information.\n\nIn addition to Bayesian statistics, other methods are also being used to search for Flight 370. For example, the US Navy is using a sonar-equipped ship to search for the plane, and the Australian government is using a team of experts to analyze radar data and other information.\n\nOverall, the search for Flight 370 is a complex and challenging task, and it will likely take a combination of different methods and approaches to locate the plane.

A total lunar eclipse, also known as a Blue Moon, will occur when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow on the moon. This event is special because it is the first time in over 150 years that a Blue Moon has occurred during a total lunar eclipse. The eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, Australia, and the western United States. The moon will appear to turn red during the eclipse due to the Earth's atmosphere scattering the light.\n\nThe event is also a Supermoon, which means that the moon will appear larger and brighter than usual due to its close proximity to Earth. This is the third Supermoon in a row, with the first two occurring on December 3 and January 1, 2018. The Supermoon will be visible for a few days after the eclipse, and it will appear larger and brighter than usual.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project will be live-streaming the event, allowing people to watch the eclipse from the comfort of their own homes. The project will also be providing a live feed of the Supermoon rising over Rome's skyline on January 1, 2018.\n\nTo capture the event, people can use a smartphone or a DSLR camera. NASA recommends using a DSLR camera with a wide-angle lens to capture the moon in context with a local landmark. The camera should be set to manual mode, with a shutter speed of 1/100th of a second and an aperture of f/8. The ISO should be set to 400.\n\nThe event is safe to view with the naked eye, and there is no need for special glasses. However, it is recommended to find a safe and comfortable viewing location, away from any obstacles or distractions.\n\nIn summary, the total lunar eclipse on January 31, 2018, is a rare and special event that will be visible from eastern Asia, Australia, and the western United States.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA.

The Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, the country's mainstream Islamist party, had already won a high percentage of the seats awarded in the first and second rounds of voting. Two of the nine provinces voting today are Brotherhood strongholds, where some of the party's most well-known candidates are running, the New York Times reports. A plurality, not a majority, was originally predicted for the Freedom and Justice Party. A majority would allow the party to govern alone, but the Brotherhood has repeatedly said it plans to form a coalition government, and has aligned itself with more liberal parties rather than the ultraconservative Salafis, who are in second place with up to 25% of the seats so far. Also today, prosecutors began presenting their case against former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Bloomberg notes. His trial resumed last week after a two-month break; state TV today showed Mubarak being carried to and from the courtroom on a gurney. \"He deserves an end of humiliation and indignity,\" said the chief prosecutor, according to the AP."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2661}
