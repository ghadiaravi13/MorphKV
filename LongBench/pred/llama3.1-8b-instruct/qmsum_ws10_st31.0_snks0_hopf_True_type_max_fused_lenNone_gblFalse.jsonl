{"pred": " The meeting discussed the downsampling of the microphone data from 48 kHz to 16 kHz, and the potential issues with the downsampling process, including the loss of high-frequency information. It was also mentioned that the data was already being processed in 16 kHz, and that the downsampling was done to make the data more manageable. The group discussed the possibility of using the original 48 kHz data for future recognition tasks, but noted that it would require more computational resources. Additionally, the meeting touched on the idea of using a different downsampling filter, such as a sinc filter, to preserve more of the high-frequency information. The group also discussed the potential benefits of using a different sampling rate, such as 44.1 kHz, which is commonly used in audio CDs. Overall, the meeting highlighted the importance of careful consideration when downsampling audio data to ensure that it does not compromise the quality of the data. The group also discussed the possibility of using a different type of microphone, such as a PZT microphone, which is known for its high-frequency response.
