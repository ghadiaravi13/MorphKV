They acknowledged that the pay settlement for schoolteachers in Wales is higher than that for FE staff, which has led to the dispute. The committee expressed concerns that the employers are using the funding issue as a reason not to negotiate a reasonable pay award, and that the dispute could have a significant impact on the recruitment and retention of staff in the FE sector. The Cabinet Secretary and Minister stated that they are aware of the position of ColegauCymru, the representative body for FE colleges in Wales, which is seeking an additional 3.5% pay award to bring FE staff pay in line with that of schoolteachers. They also acknowledged that the dispute could have implications for the pensions of FE staff, with one college estimating that the cost of pension changes could be £1 million. The committee agreed to keep a close eye on the situation and to seek further information from the Welsh Government on their plans to support the FE sector in resolving the dispute.
